Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but\nnot from an individual--he is a combination of the characteristics of\nthree boys whom I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of\narchitecture.\n\nThe odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children\nand slaves in the West at the period of this story--that is to say,\nthirty or forty years ago.\n\nAlthough my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and\ngirls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,\nfor part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what\nthey once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,\nand what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.\n\n                                                            THE AUTHOR.\n\nHARTFORD, 1876.\n\n\n\n                          T O M   S A W Y E R\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\"TOM!\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"TOM!\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!\"\n\nNo answer.\n\nThe old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the\nroom; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or\nnever looked THROUGH them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her\nstate pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for \"style,\" not\nservice--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.\nShe looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but\nstill loud enough for the furniture to hear:\n\n\"Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll--\"\n\nShe did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching\nunder the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the\npunches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.\n\n\"I never did see the beat of that boy!\"\n\nShe went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the\ntomato vines and \"jimpson\" weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom.\nSo she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and\nshouted:\n\n\"Y-o-u-u TOM!\"\n\nThere was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to\nseize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.\n\n\"There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been doing in\nthere?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What IS that\ntruck?\"\n\n\"I don't know, aunt.\"\n\n\"Well, I know. It's jam--that's what it is. Forty times I've said if\nyou didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me that switch.\"\n\nThe switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--\n\n\"My! Look behind you, aunt!\"\n\nThe old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger. The\nlad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and\ndisappeared over it.\n\nHis aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle\nlaugh.\n\n\"Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played me tricks\nenough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old\nfools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks,\nas the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,\nand how is a body to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just how\nlong he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he\ncan make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down\nagain and I can't hit him a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy,\nand that's the Lord's truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile\nthe child, as the Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and suffering for\nus both, I know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he's my\nown dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash\nhim, somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so,\nand every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man\nthat is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the\nScripture says, and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this evening, *\nand [* Southwestern for \"afternoon\"] I'll just be obleeged to make him\nwork, to-morrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work\nSaturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more\nthan he hates anything else, and I've GOT to do some of my duty by him,\nor I'll be the ruination of the child.\"\n\nTom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home\nbarely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day's\nwood and split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in\ntime to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the\nwork. Tom's younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already\nthrough with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a\nquiet boy, and had no adventurous, troublesome ways.\n\nWhile Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity\noffered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and\nvery deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like\nmany other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she\nwas endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she\nloved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low\ncunning. Said she:\n\n\"Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes'm.\"\n\n\"Powerful warm, warn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes'm.\"\n\n\"Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?\"\n\nA bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion.\nHe searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing. So he said:\n\n\"No'm--well, not very much.\"\n\nThe old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said:\n\n\"But you ain't too warm now, though.\" And it flattered her to reflect\nthat she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing\nthat that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew\nwhere the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:\n\n\"Some of us pumped on our heads--mine's damp yet. See?\"\n\nAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of\ncircumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new\ninspiration:\n\n\"Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to\npump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!\"\n\nThe trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His\nshirt collar was securely sewed.\n\n\"Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey\nand been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a\nsinged cat, as the saying is--better'n you look. THIS time.\"\n\nShe was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom\nhad stumbled into obedient conduct for once.\n\nBut Sidney said:\n\n\"Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread,\nbut it's black.\"\n\n\"Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!\"\n\nBut Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:\n\n\"Siddy, I'll lick you for that.\"\n\nIn a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into\nthe lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle\ncarried white thread and the other black. He said:\n\n\"She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes\nshe sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to\ngeeminy she'd stick to one or t'other--I can't keep the run of 'em. But\nI bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll learn him!\"\n\nHe was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very\nwell though--and loathed him.\n\nWithin two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles.\nNot because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him\nthan a man's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore\nthem down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men's\nmisfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This\nnew interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just\nacquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed.\nIt consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,\nproduced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short\nintervals in the midst of the music--the reader probably remembers how\nto do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave\nhim the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full\nof harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an\nastronomer feels who has discovered a new planet--no doubt, as far as\nstrong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with\nthe boy, not the astronomer.\n\nThe summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom\nchecked his whistle. A stranger was before him--a boy a shade larger\nthan himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an impressive\ncuriosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy\nwas well dressed, too--well dressed on a week-day. This was simply\nastounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth\nroundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes\non--and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of\nribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The\nmore Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his\nnose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed\nto him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved--but\nonly sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all\nthe time. Finally Tom said:\n\n\"I can lick you!\"\n\n\"I'd like to see you try it.\"\n\n\"Well, I can do it.\"\n\n\"No you can't, either.\"\n\n\"Yes I can.\"\n\n\"No you can't.\"\n\n\"I can.\"\n\n\"You can't.\"\n\n\"Can!\"\n\n\"Can't!\"\n\nAn uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"'Tisn't any of your business, maybe.\"\n\n\"Well I 'low I'll MAKE it my business.\"\n\n\"Well why don't you?\"\n\n\"If you say much, I will.\"\n\n\"Much--much--MUCH. There now.\"\n\n\"Oh, you think you're mighty smart, DON'T you? I could lick you with\none hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.\"\n\n\"Well why don't you DO it? You SAY you can do it.\"\n\n\"Well I WILL, if you fool with me.\"\n\n\"Oh yes--I've seen whole families in the same fix.\"\n\n\"Smarty! You think you're SOME, now, DON'T you? Oh, what a hat!\"\n\n\"You can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to knock it\noff--and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs.\"\n\n\"You're a liar!\"\n\n\"You're another.\"\n\n\"You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up.\"\n\n\"Aw--take a walk!\"\n\n\"Say--if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a\nrock off'n your head.\"\n\n\"Oh, of COURSE you will.\"\n\n\"Well I WILL.\"\n\n\"Well why don't you DO it then? What do you keep SAYING you will for?\nWhy don't you DO it? It's because you're afraid.\"\n\n\"I AIN'T afraid.\"\n\n\"You are.\"\n\n\"I ain't.\"\n\n\"You are.\"\n\nAnother pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently\nthey were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:\n\n\"Get away from here!\"\n\n\"Go away yourself!\"\n\n\"I won't.\"\n\n\"I won't either.\"\n\nSo they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and\nboth shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with\nhate. But neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both\nwere hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution,\nand Tom said:\n\n\"You're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you, and he\ncan thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him do it, too.\"\n\n\"What do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother that's bigger\nthan he is--and what's more, he can throw him over that fence, too.\"\n[Both brothers were imaginary.]\n\n\"That's a lie.\"\n\n\"YOUR saying so don't make it so.\"\n\nTom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:\n\n\"I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you can't stand\nup. Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep.\"\n\nThe new boy stepped over promptly, and said:\n\n\"Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it.\"\n\n\"Don't you crowd me now; you better look out.\"\n\n\"Well, you SAID you'd do it--why don't you do it?\"\n\n\"By jingo! for two cents I WILL do it.\"\n\nThe new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out\nwith derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys\nwere rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and\nfor the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and\nclothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered\nthemselves with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and\nthrough the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and\npounding him with his fists. \"Holler 'nuff!\" said he.\n\nThe boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying--mainly from rage.\n\n\"Holler 'nuff!\"--and the pounding went on.\n\nAt last the stranger got out a smothered \"'Nuff!\" and Tom let him up\nand said:\n\n\"Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling with next\ntime.\"\n\nThe new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,\nsnuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and\nthreatening what he would do to Tom the \"next time he caught him out.\"\nTo which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and\nas soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw\nit and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like\nan antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he\nlived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the\nenemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the\nwindow and declined. At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called\nTom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went\naway; but he said he \"'lowed\" to \"lay\" for that boy.\n\nHe got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in\nat the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt;\nand when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn\nhis Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in\nits firmness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nSATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and\nfresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if\nthe heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in\nevery face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom\nand the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond\nthe village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far\nenough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.\n\nTom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a\nlong-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and\na deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board\nfence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a\nburden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost\nplank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant\nwhitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed\nfence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at\nthe gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from\nthe town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but\nnow it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at\nthe pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there\nwaiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling,\nfighting, skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only\na hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of\nwater under an hour--and even then somebody generally had to go after\nhim. Tom said:\n\n\"Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some.\"\n\nJim shook his head and said:\n\n\"Can't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git dis\nwater an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. She say she spec' Mars\nTom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go 'long an' 'tend\nto my own business--she 'lowed SHE'D 'tend to de whitewashin'.\"\n\n\"Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That's the way she always\ntalks. Gimme the bucket--I won't be gone only a a minute. SHE won't\never know.\"\n\n\"Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head off'n\nme. 'Deed she would.\"\n\n\"SHE! She never licks anybody--whacks 'em over the head with her\nthimble--and who cares for that, I'd like to know. She talks awful, but\ntalk don't hurt--anyways it don't if she don't cry. Jim, I'll give you\na marvel. I'll give you a white alley!\"\n\nJim began to waver.\n\n\"White alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw.\"\n\n\"My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I's powerful\n'fraid ole missis--\"\n\n\"And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe.\"\n\nJim was only human--this attraction was too much for him. He put down\nhis pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing\ninterest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was\nflying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was\nwhitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field\nwith a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.\n\nBut Tom's energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had\nplanned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys\nwould come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and\nthey would make a world of fun of him for having to work--the very\nthought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and\nexamined it--bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an\nexchange of WORK, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an\nhour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his\npocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark\nand hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a\ngreat, magnificent inspiration.\n\nHe took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in\nsight presently--the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been\ndreading. Ben's gait was the hop-skip-and-jump--proof enough that his\nheart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and\ngiving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned\nding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As\nhe drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned\nfar over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious\npomp and circumstance--for he was personating the Big Missouri, and\nconsidered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and\ncaptain and engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself\nstanding on his own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:\n\n\"Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!\" The headway ran almost out, and he\ndrew up slowly toward the sidewalk.\n\n\"Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!\" His arms straightened and\nstiffened down his sides.\n\n\"Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!\nChow!\" His right hand, meantime, describing stately circles--for it was\nrepresenting a forty-foot wheel.\n\n\"Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-lingling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!\"\nThe left hand began to describe circles.\n\n\"Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead\non the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow!\nTing-a-ling-ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! LIVELY now!\nCome--out with your spring-line--what're you about there! Take a turn\nround that stump with the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now--let her\ngo! Done with the engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH'T! S'H'T! SH'T!\"\n(trying the gauge-cocks).\n\nTom went on whitewashing--paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben\nstared a moment and then said: \"Hi-YI! YOU'RE up a stump, ain't you!\"\n\nNo answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then\nhe gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as\nbefore. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom's mouth watered for the\napple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:\n\n\"Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?\"\n\nTom wheeled suddenly and said:\n\n\"Why, it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing.\"\n\n\"Say--I'm going in a-swimming, I am. Don't you wish you could? But of\ncourse you'd druther WORK--wouldn't you? Course you would!\"\n\nTom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:\n\n\"What do you call work?\"\n\n\"Why, ain't THAT work?\"\n\nTom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:\n\n\"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it suits Tom\nSawyer.\"\n\n\"Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you LIKE it?\"\n\nThe brush continued to move.\n\n\"Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a boy get\na chance to whitewash a fence every day?\"\n\nThat put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tom\nswept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the\neffect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again--Ben\nwatching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more\nabsorbed. Presently he said:\n\n\"Say, Tom, let ME whitewash a little.\"\n\nTom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:\n\n\"No--no--I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly's\nawful particular about this fence--right here on the street, you know\n--but if it was the back fence I wouldn't mind and SHE wouldn't. Yes,\nshe's awful particular about this fence; it's got to be done very\ncareful; I reckon there ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two\nthousand, that can do it the way it's got to be done.\"\n\n\"No--is that so? Oh come, now--lemme just try. Only just a little--I'd\nlet YOU, if you was me, Tom.\"\n\n\"Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly--well, Jim wanted to\ndo it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn't\nlet Sid. Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If you was to tackle this\nfence and anything was to happen to it--\"\n\n\"Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say--I'll give\nyou the core of my apple.\"\n\n\"Well, here--No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard--\"\n\n\"I'll give you ALL of it!\"\n\nTom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his\nheart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in\nthe sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,\ndangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more\ninnocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every\nlittle while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time\nBen was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for\na kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in\nfor a dead rat and a string to swing it with--and so on, and so on,\nhour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being\na poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling\nin wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles,\npart of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a\nspool cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk,\na glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six\nfire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass doorknob, a\ndog-collar--but no dog--the handle of a knife, four pieces of\norange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.\n\nHe had had a nice, good, idle time all the while--plenty of company\n--and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn't run out\nof whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.\n\nTom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He\nhad discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it--namely,\nthat in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only\nnecessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great\nand wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have\ncomprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do,\nand that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And\nthis would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers\nor performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or\nclimbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in\nEngland who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles\non a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them\nconsiderable money; but if they were offered wages for the service,\nthat would turn it into work and then they would resign.\n\nThe boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place\nin his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to\nreport.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open\nwindow in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,\nbreakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer\nair, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing murmur\nof the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her knitting\n--for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her lap. Her\nspectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had thought\nthat of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at seeing him\nplace himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He said: \"Mayn't\nI go and play now, aunt?\"\n\n\"What, a'ready? How much have you done?\"\n\n\"It's all done, aunt.\"\n\n\"Tom, don't lie to me--I can't bear it.\"\n\n\"I ain't, aunt; it IS all done.\"\n\nAunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see\nfor herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent.\nof Tom's statement true. When she found the entire fence whitewashed,\nand not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even\na streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable.\nShe said:\n\n\"Well, I never! There's no getting round it, you can work when you're\na mind to, Tom.\" And then she diluted the compliment by adding, \"But\nit's powerful seldom you're a mind to, I'm bound to say. Well, go 'long\nand play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I'll tan you.\"\n\nShe was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took\nhim into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to\nhim, along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a\ntreat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.\nAnd while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he \"hooked\" a\ndoughnut.\n\nThen he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway\nthat led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and\nthe air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a\nhail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties\nand sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,\nand Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general\nthing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at\npeace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his\nblack thread and getting him into trouble.\n\nTom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by\nthe back of his aunt's cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the\nreach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square\nof the village, where two \"military\" companies of boys had met for\nconflict, according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of\nthese armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These\ntwo great commanders did not condescend to fight in person--that being\nbetter suited to the still smaller fry--but sat together on an eminence\nand conducted the field operations by orders delivered through\naides-de-camp. Tom's army won a great victory, after a long and\nhard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,\nthe terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the\nnecessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and\nmarched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.\n\nAs he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new\ngirl in the garden--a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair\nplaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered\npantalettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A\ncertain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a\nmemory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;\nhe had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor\nlittle evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had\nconfessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest\nboy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time\nshe had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is\ndone.\n\nHe worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she\nhad discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present,\nand began to \"show off\" in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to\nwin her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some\ntime; but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous\ngymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl\nwas wending her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and\nleaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer.\nShe halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom\nheaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face\nlit up, right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment\nbefore she disappeared.\n\nThe boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and\nthen shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if\nhe had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.\nPresently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his\nnose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,\nin his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally\nhis bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he\nhopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But\nonly for a minute--only while he could button the flower inside his\njacket, next his heart--or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not\nmuch posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.\n\nHe returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, \"showing\noff,\" as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom\ncomforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some\nwindow, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode\nhome reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.\n\nAll through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered\n\"what had got into the child.\" He took a good scolding about clodding\nSid, and did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar\nunder his aunt's very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:\n\n\"Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it.\"\n\n\"Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do. You'd be always into\nthat sugar if I warn't watching you.\"\n\nPresently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his\nimmunity, reached for the sugar-bowl--a sort of glorying over Tom which\nwas wellnigh unbearable. But Sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped\nand broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even\ncontrolled his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would\nnot speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly\nstill till she asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and\nthere would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model\n\"catch it.\" He was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold\nhimself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck\ndischarging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles. He said to\nhimself, \"Now it's coming!\" And the next instant he was sprawling on\nthe floor! The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried\nout:\n\n\"Hold on, now, what 'er you belting ME for?--Sid broke it!\"\n\nAunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But\nwhen she got her tongue again, she only said:\n\n\"Umf! Well, you didn't get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some\nother audacious mischief when I wasn't around, like enough.\"\n\nThen her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something\nkind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a\nconfession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.\nSo she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.\nTom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart\nhis aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the\nconsciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice\nof none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,\nthrough a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured\nhimself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching\none little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and\ndie with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured\nhimself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and\nhis sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how\nher tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back\nher boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie\nthere cold and white and make no sign--a poor little sufferer, whose\ngriefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos\nof these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to\nchoke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he\nwinked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a\nluxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear\nto have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it;\nit was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin\nMary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an\nage-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in\nclouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in\nat the other.\n\nHe wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought\ndesolate places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the\nriver invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and\ncontemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while,\nthat he could only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without\nundergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought\nof his flower. He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily\nincreased his dismal felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she\nknew? Would she cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms\naround his neck and comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all\nthe hollow world? This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable\nsuffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it\nup in new and varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he\nrose up sighing and departed in the darkness.\n\nAbout half-past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street\nto where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell\nupon his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the\ncurtain of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He\nclimbed the fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till\nhe stood under that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion;\nthen he laid him down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon\nhis back, with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor\nwilted flower. And thus he would die--out in the cold world, with no\nshelter over his homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the\ndeath-damps from his brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him\nwhen the great agony came. And thus SHE would see him when she looked\nout upon the glad morning, and oh! would she drop one little tear upon\nhis poor, lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see a bright\nyoung life so rudely blighted, so untimely cut down?\n\nThe window went up, a maid-servant's discordant voice profaned the\nholy calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains!\n\nThe strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz\nas of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound\nas of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the\nfence and shot away in the gloom.\n\nNot long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his\ndrenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he\nhad any dim idea of making any \"references to allusions,\" he thought\nbetter of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom's eye.\n\nTom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made\nmental note of the omission.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful\nvillage like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family\nworship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid\ncourses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of\noriginality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter\nof the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.\n\nThen Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to \"get\nhis verses.\" Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his\nenergies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the\nSermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.\nAt the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,\nbut no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human\nthought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary\ntook his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through\nthe fog:\n\n\"Blessed are the--a--a--\"\n\n\"Poor\"--\n\n\"Yes--poor; blessed are the poor--a--a--\"\n\n\"In spirit--\"\n\n\"In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they--they--\"\n\n\"THEIRS--\"\n\n\"For THEIRS. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom\nof heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they--they--\"\n\n\"Sh--\"\n\n\"For they--a--\"\n\n\"S, H, A--\"\n\n\"For they S, H--Oh, I don't know what it is!\"\n\n\"SHALL!\"\n\n\"Oh, SHALL! for they shall--for they shall--a--a--shall mourn--a--a--\nblessed are they that shall--they that--a--they that shall mourn, for\nthey shall--a--shall WHAT? Why don't you tell me, Mary?--what do you\nwant to be so mean for?\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I'm not teasing you. I wouldn't\ndo that. You must go and learn it again. Don't you be discouraged, Tom,\nyou'll manage it--and if you do, I'll give you something ever so nice.\nThere, now, that's a good boy.\"\n\n\"All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.\"\n\n\"Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it's nice, it is nice.\"\n\n\"You bet you that's so, Mary. All right, I'll tackle it again.\"\n\nAnd he did \"tackle it again\"--and under the double pressure of\ncuriosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he\naccomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new \"Barlow\"\nknife worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that\nswept his system shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would\nnot cut anything, but it was a \"sure-enough\" Barlow, and there was\ninconceivable grandeur in that--though where the Western boys ever got\nthe idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its\ninjury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom\ncontrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin\non the bureau, when he was called off to dress for Sunday-school.\n\nMary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went\noutside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he\ndipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;\npoured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the\nkitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the\ndoor. But Mary removed the towel and said:\n\n\"Now ain't you ashamed, Tom. You mustn't be so bad. Water won't hurt\nyou.\"\n\nTom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time\nhe stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big\nbreath and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes\nshut and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony\nof suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from\nthe towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped\nshort at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line\nthere was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in\nfront and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she\nwas done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of\ncolor, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls\nwrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately\nsmoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his\nhair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and\nhis own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of\nhis clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years--they\nwere simply called his \"other clothes\"--and so by that we know the\nsize of his wardrobe. The girl \"put him to rights\" after he had dressed\nhimself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his\nvast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned\nhim with his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and\nuncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there\nwas a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He\nhoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she\ncoated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them\nout. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do\neverything he didn't want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:\n\n\"Please, Tom--that's a good boy.\"\n\nSo he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three\nchildren set out for Sunday-school--a place that Tom hated with his\nwhole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.\n\nSabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church\nservice. Two of the children always remained for the sermon\nvoluntarily, and the other always remained too--for stronger reasons.\nThe church's high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three\nhundred persons; the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort\nof pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom\ndropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:\n\n\"Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What'll you take for her?\"\n\n\"What'll you give?\"\n\n\"Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.\"\n\n\"Less see 'em.\"\n\nTom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.\nThen Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and\nsome small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other\nboys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or\nfifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm of\nclean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a\nquarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,\nelderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a\nboy's hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy\nturned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear\nhim say \"Ouch!\" and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom's whole\nclass were of a pattern--restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they\ncame to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses\nperfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, they worried\nthrough, and each got his reward--in small blue tickets, each with a\npassage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of\nthe recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be\nexchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow\ntickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty\ncents in those easy times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would\nhave the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses, even\nfor a Dore Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way--it\nwas the patient work of two years--and a boy of German parentage had\nwon four or five. He once recited three thousand verses without\nstopping; but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and\nhe was little better than an idiot from that day forth--a grievous\nmisfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before company, the\nsuperintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made this boy come out\nand \"spread himself.\" Only the older pupils managed to keep their\ntickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible, and\nso the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy\ncircumstance; the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for\nthat day that on the spot every scholar's heart was fired with a fresh\nambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that Tom's\nmental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but\nunquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory\nand the eclat that came with it.\n\nIn due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with\na closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its\nleaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent\nmakes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as\nnecessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer\nwho stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert\n--though why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of\nmusic is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a\nslim creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair;\nhe wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his\nears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his\nmouth--a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning\nof the whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped\non a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note,\nand had fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the\nfashion of the day, like sleigh-runners--an effect patiently and\nlaboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes\npressed against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest\nof mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred\nthings and places in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly\nmatters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had\nacquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He\nbegan after this fashion:\n\n\"Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty\nas you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There\n--that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see\none little girl who is looking out of the window--I am afraid she\nthinks I am out there somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making\na speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you\nhow good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces\nassembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good.\" And\nso forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the\noration. It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar\nto us all.\n\nThe latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights\nand other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings\nand whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases\nof isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every\nsound ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters' voice, and\nthe conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent\ngratitude.\n\nA good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which\nwas more or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher,\naccompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged\ngentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless\nthe latter's wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless\nand full of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too--he could\nnot meet Amy Lawrence's eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But\nwhen he saw this small new-comer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in\na moment. The next moment he was \"showing off\" with all his might\n--cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces--in a word, using every art\nthat seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. His\nexaltation had but one alloy--the memory of his humiliation in this\nangel's garden--and that record in sand was fast washing out, under\nthe waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.\n\nThe visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.\nWalters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The\nmiddle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage--no less a one\nthan the county judge--altogether the most august creation these\nchildren had ever looked upon--and they wondered what kind of material\nhe was made of--and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half\nafraid he might, too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away--so\nhe had travelled, and seen the world--these very eyes had looked upon\nthe county court-house--which was said to have a tin roof. The awe\nwhich these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence\nand the ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher,\nbrother of their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to\nbe familiar with the great man and be envied by the school. It would\nhave been music to his soul to hear the whisperings:\n\n\"Look at him, Jim! He's a going up there. Say--look! he's a going to\nshake hands with him--he IS shaking hands with him! By jings, don't you\nwish you was Jeff?\"\n\nMr. Walters fell to \"showing off,\" with all sorts of official\nbustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments,\ndischarging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a\ntarget. The librarian \"showed off\"--running hither and thither with his\narms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that\ninsect authority delights in. The young lady teachers \"showed off\"\n--bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting\npretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones\nlovingly. The young gentlemen teachers \"showed off\" with small\nscoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to\ndiscipline--and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up\nat the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had\nto be done over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation).\nThe little girls \"showed off\" in various ways, and the little boys\n\"showed off\" with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads\nand the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and\nbeamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself\nin the sun of his own grandeur--for he was \"showing off,\" too.\n\nThere was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy\ncomplete, and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a\nprodigy. Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough\n--he had been around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given\nworlds, now, to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.\n\nAnd now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward\nwith nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and\ndemanded a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters\nwas not expecting an application from this source for the next ten\nyears. But there was no getting around it--here were the certified\nchecks, and they were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated\nto a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was\nannounced from headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the\ndecade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero\nup to the judicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to\ngaze upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy--but\nthose that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too\nlate that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by\ntrading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling\nwhitewashing privileges. These despised themselves, as being the dupes\nof a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.\n\nThe prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the\nsuperintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked\nsomewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct taught him\nthat there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,\nperhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two\nthousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises--a dozen would\nstrain his capacity, without a doubt.\n\nAmy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in\nher face--but he wouldn't look. She wondered; then she was just a grain\ntroubled; next a dim suspicion came and went--came again; she watched;\na furtive glance told her worlds--and then her heart broke, and she was\njealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom\nmost of all (she thought).\n\nTom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath\nwould hardly come, his heart quaked--partly because of the awful\ngreatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would\nhave liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The\nJudge put his hand on Tom's head and called him a fine little man, and\nasked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:\n\n\"Tom.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, not Tom--it is--\"\n\n\"Thomas.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That's very\nwell. But you've another one I daresay, and you'll tell it to me, won't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,\" said Walters, \"and say\nsir. You mustn't forget your manners.\"\n\n\"Thomas Sawyer--sir.\"\n\n\"That's it! That's a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow.\nTwo thousand verses is a great many--very, very great many. And you\nnever can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for\nknowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world; it's what\nmakes great men and good men; you'll be a great man and a good man\nyourself, some day, Thomas, and then you'll look back and say, It's all\nowing to the precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood--it's all\nowing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn--it's all owing to\nthe good superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and\ngave me a beautiful Bible--a splendid elegant Bible--to keep and have\nit all for my own, always--it's all owing to right bringing up! That is\nwhat you will say, Thomas--and you wouldn't take any money for those\ntwo thousand verses--no indeed you wouldn't. And now you wouldn't mind\ntelling me and this lady some of the things you've learned--no, I know\nyou wouldn't--for we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no\ndoubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. Won't you tell us\nthe names of the first two that were appointed?\"\n\nTom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,\nnow, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters' heart sank within him. He said to\nhimself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest\nquestion--why DID the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up\nand say:\n\n\"Answer the gentleman, Thomas--don't be afraid.\"\n\nTom still hung fire.\n\n\"Now I know you'll tell me,\" said the lady. \"The names of the first\ntwo disciples were--\"\n\n\"DAVID AND GOLIAH!\"\n\nLet us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to\nring, and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon.\nThe Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and\noccupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt\nPolly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her--Tom being placed\nnext the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open\nwindow and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd\nfiled up the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better\ndays; the mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other\nunnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair,\nsmart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her\nhill mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and\nmuch the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg\ncould boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer\nRiverson, the new notable from a distance; next the belle of the\nvillage, followed by a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young\nheart-breakers; then all the young clerks in town in a body--for they\nhad stood in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of\noiled and simpering admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet;\nand last of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful\ncare of his mother as if she were cut glass. He always brought his\nmother to church, and was the pride of all the matrons. The boys all\nhated him, he was so good. And besides, he had been \"thrown up to them\"\nso much. His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as\nusual on Sundays--accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked\nupon boys who had as snobs.\n\nThe congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,\nto warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the\nchurch which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the\nchoir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all\nthrough service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,\nbut I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,\nand I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in\nsome foreign country.\n\nThe minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in\na peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country.\nHis voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached\na certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost\nword and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:\n\n  Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry BEDS of ease,\n\n  Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' BLOODY seas?\n\nHe was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church \"sociables\" he was\nalways called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies\nwould lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,\nand \"wall\" their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, \"Words\ncannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal\nearth.\"\n\nAfter the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into\na bulletin-board, and read off \"notices\" of meetings and societies and\nthings till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of\ndoom--a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,\naway here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is\nto justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.\n\nAnd now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went\ninto details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the\nchurch; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;\nfor the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United\nStates; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the\nPresident; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed\nby stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of\nEuropean monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light\nand the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear\nwithal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with\na supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace\nand favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a\ngrateful harvest of good. Amen.\n\nThere was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat\ndown. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer,\nhe only endured it--if he even did that much. He was restive all\nthrough it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously\n--for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the\nclergyman's regular route over it--and when a little trifle of new\nmatter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature\nresented it; he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the\nmidst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of\nhim and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together,\nembracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously that\nit seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender thread\nof a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs\nand smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going\nthrough its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly\nsafe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom's hands itched to grab for\nit they did not dare--he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed\nif he did such a thing while the prayer was going on. But with the\nclosing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the\ninstant the \"Amen\" was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt\ndetected the act and made him let it go.\n\nThe minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through\nan argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod\n--and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone\nand thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be\nhardly worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after\nchurch he always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew\nanything else about the discourse. However, this time he was really\ninterested for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving\npicture of the assembling together of the world's hosts at the\nmillennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a\nlittle child should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of\nthe great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the\nconspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking\nnations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he\nwished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.\n\nNow he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.\nPresently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was\na large black beetle with formidable jaws--a \"pinchbug,\" he called it.\nIt was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to\ntake him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went\nfloundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger\nwent into the boy's mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless\nlegs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was\nsafe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found\nrelief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle\ndog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and\nthe quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle;\nthe drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked\naround it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again;\ngrew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a\ngingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another;\nbegan to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle\nbetween his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last,\nand then indifferent and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by\nlittle his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There\nwas a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle's head, and the beetle fell a\ncouple of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring\nspectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind\nfans and handkerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked\nfoolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart,\ntoo, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a\nwary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle,\nlighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even\ncloser snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his\nears flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried\nto amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant\naround, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of that;\nyawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then\nthere was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the\naisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in\nfront of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the\ndoors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his\nprogress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit\nwith the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer\nsheered from its course, and sprang into its master's lap; he flung it\nout of the window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and\ndied in the distance.\n\nBy this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with\nsuppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. The\ndiscourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all\npossibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest\nsentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of\nunholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor\nparson had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to\nthe whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction\npronounced.\n\nTom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there\nwas some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of\nvariety in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the\ndog should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright\nin him to carry it off.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nMONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found\nhim so--because it began another week's slow suffering in school. He\ngenerally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening\nholiday, it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much\nmore odious.\n\nTom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was\nsick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague\npossibility. He canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he\ninvestigated again. This time he thought he could detect colicky\nsymptoms, and he began to encourage them with considerable hope. But\nthey soon grew feeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected\nfurther. Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth\nwas loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a\n\"starter,\" as he called it, when it occurred to him that if he came\ninto court with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that\nwould hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the\npresent, and seek further. Nothing offered for some little time, and\nthen he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that\nlaid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him\nlose a finger. So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the\nsheet and held it up for inspection. But now he did not know the\nnecessary symptoms. However, it seemed well worth while to chance it,\nso he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.\n\nBut Sid slept on unconscious.\n\nTom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.\n\nNo result from Sid.\n\nTom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and\nthen swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.\n\nSid snored on.\n\nTom was aggravated. He said, \"Sid, Sid!\" and shook him. This course\nworked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then\nbrought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at\nTom. Tom went on groaning. Sid said:\n\n\"Tom! Say, Tom!\" [No response.] \"Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,\nTom?\" And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.\n\nTom moaned out:\n\n\"Oh, don't, Sid. Don't joggle me.\"\n\n\"Why, what's the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.\"\n\n\"No--never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody.\"\n\n\"But I must! DON'T groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been this\nway?\"\n\n\"Hours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me.\"\n\n\"Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, DON'T! It makes my\nflesh crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?\"\n\n\"I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you've ever done\nto me. When I'm gone--\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom, you ain't dying, are you? Don't, Tom--oh, don't. Maybe--\"\n\n\"I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid, you\ngive my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that's\ncome to town, and tell her--\"\n\nBut Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in\nreality, now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his\ngroans had gathered quite a genuine tone.\n\nSid flew down-stairs and said:\n\n\"Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!\"\n\n\"Dying!\"\n\n\"Yes'm. Don't wait--come quick!\"\n\n\"Rubbage! I don't believe it!\"\n\nBut she fled up-stairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.\nAnd her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached\nthe bedside she gasped out:\n\n\"You, Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?\"\n\n\"Oh, auntie, I'm--\"\n\n\"What's the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?\"\n\n\"Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!\"\n\nThe old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a\nlittle, then did both together. This restored her and she said:\n\n\"Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and\nclimb out of this.\"\n\nThe groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a\nlittle foolish, and he said:\n\n\"Aunt Polly, it SEEMED mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my\ntooth at all.\"\n\n\"Your tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?\"\n\n\"One of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful.\"\n\n\"There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.\nWell--your tooth IS loose, but you're not going to die about that.\nMary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.\"\n\nTom said:\n\n\"Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish\nI may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I don't want to stay\nhome from school.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you thought\nyou'd get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love\nyou so, and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart\nwith your outrageousness.\" By this time the dental instruments were\nready. The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom's tooth\nwith a loop and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the\nchunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy's face. The\ntooth hung dangling by the bedpost, now.\n\nBut all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school\nafter breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in\nhis upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and\nadmirable way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the\nexhibition; and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of\nfascination and homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly\nwithout an adherent, and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and\nhe said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasn't anything to\nspit like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, \"Sour grapes!\" and he\nwandered away a dismantled hero.\n\nShortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry\nFinn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and\ndreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless\nand vulgar and bad--and because all their children admired him so, and\ndelighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like\nhim. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied\nHuckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders\nnot to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.\nHuckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown\nmen, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat\nwas a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,\nwhen he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons\nfar down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat\nof the trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs\ndragged in the dirt when not rolled up.\n\nHuckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps\nin fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to\nschool or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could\ngo fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it\nsuited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he\npleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring\nand the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor\nput on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything\nthat goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every\nharassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.\n\nTom hailed the romantic outcast:\n\n\"Hello, Huckleberry!\"\n\n\"Hello yourself, and see how you like it.\"\n\n\"What's that you got?\"\n\n\"Dead cat.\"\n\n\"Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get him ?\"\n\n\"Bought him off'n a boy.\"\n\n\"What did you give?\"\n\n\"I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.\"\n\n\"Where'd you get the blue ticket?\"\n\n\"Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.\"\n\n\"Say--what is dead cats good for, Huck?\"\n\n\"Good for? Cure warts with.\"\n\n\"No! Is that so? I know something that's better.\"\n\n\"I bet you don't. What is it?\"\n\n\"Why, spunk-water.\"\n\n\"Spunk-water! I wouldn't give a dern for spunk-water.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't, wouldn't you? D'you ever try it?\"\n\n\"No, I hain't. But Bob Tanner did.\"\n\n\"Who told you so!\"\n\n\"Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny\ntold Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and\nthe nigger told me. There now!\"\n\n\"Well, what of it? They'll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I\ndon't know HIM. But I never see a nigger that WOULDN'T lie. Shucks! Now\nyou tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.\"\n\n\"Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the\nrain-water was.\"\n\n\"In the daytime?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"With his face to the stump?\"\n\n\"Yes. Least I reckon so.\"\n\n\"Did he say anything?\"\n\n\"I don't reckon he did. I don't know.\"\n\n\"Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame\nfool way as that! Why, that ain't a-going to do any good. You got to go\nall by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there's a\nspunk-water stump, and just as it's midnight you back up against the\nstump and jam your hand in and say:\n\n  'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,\n   Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,'\n\nand then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then\nturn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.\nBecause if you speak the charm's busted.\"\n\n\"Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob Tanner\ndone.\"\n\n\"No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in this\ntown; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to work\nspunk-water. I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,\nHuck. I play with frogs so much that I've always got considerable many\nwarts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean.\"\n\n\"Yes, bean's good. I've done that.\"\n\n\"Have you? What's your way?\"\n\n\"You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some\nblood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and\ndig a hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of\nthe moon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece\nthat's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to\nfetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the\nwart, and pretty soon off she comes.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it, Huck--that's it; though when you're burying it if you\nsay 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!' it's better.\nThat's the way Joe Harper does, and he's been nearly to Coonville and\nmost everywheres. But say--how do you cure 'em with dead cats?\"\n\n\"Why, you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard 'long about\nmidnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it's\nmidnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can't see\n'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear 'em talk;\nand when they're taking that feller away, you heave your cat after 'em\nand say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I'm\ndone with ye!' That'll fetch ANY wart.\"\n\n\"Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?\"\n\n\"No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.\"\n\n\"Well, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a witch.\"\n\n\"Say! Why, Tom, I KNOW she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own\nself. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he\ntook up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged, he'd a got her. Well, that\nvery night he rolled off'n a shed wher' he was a layin drunk, and broke\nhis arm.\"\n\n\"Why, that's awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?\"\n\n\"Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you\nright stiddy, they're a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz\nwhen they mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer backards.\"\n\n\"Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?\"\n\n\"To-night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.\"\n\n\"But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday night?\"\n\n\"Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?--and\nTHEN it's Sunday. Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday, I don't\nreckon.\"\n\n\"I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?\"\n\n\"Of course--if you ain't afeard.\"\n\n\"Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?\"\n\n\"Yes--and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep' me\na-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says\n'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his window--but don't\nyou tell.\"\n\n\"I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me,\nbut I'll meow this time. Say--what's that?\"\n\n\"Nothing but a tick.\"\n\n\"Where'd you get him?\"\n\n\"Out in the woods.\"\n\n\"What'll you take for him?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I don't want to sell him.\"\n\n\"All right. It's a mighty small tick, anyway.\"\n\n\"Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them. I'm\nsatisfied with it. It's a good enough tick for me.\"\n\n\"Sho, there's ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of 'em if I\nwanted to.\"\n\n\"Well, why don't you? Becuz you know mighty well you can't. This is a\npretty early tick, I reckon. It's the first one I've seen this year.\"\n\n\"Say, Huck--I'll give you my tooth for him.\"\n\n\"Less see it.\"\n\nTom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry\nviewed it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:\n\n\"Is it genuwyne?\"\n\nTom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.\n\n\"Well, all right,\" said Huckleberry, \"it's a trade.\"\n\nTom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been\nthe pinchbug's prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier\nthan before.\n\nWhen Tom reached the little isolated frame schoolhouse, he strode in\nbriskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed.\nHe hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with\nbusiness-like alacrity. The master, throned on high in his great\nsplint-bottom arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study.\nThe interruption roused him.\n\n\"Thomas Sawyer!\"\n\nTom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.\n\n\"Sir!\"\n\n\"Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?\"\n\nTom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of\nyellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric\nsympathy of love; and by that form was THE ONLY VACANT PLACE on the\ngirls' side of the schoolhouse. He instantly said:\n\n\"I STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN!\"\n\nThe master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of\nstudy ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his\nmind. The master said:\n\n\"You--you did what?\"\n\n\"Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.\"\n\nThere was no mistaking the words.\n\n\"Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever\nlistened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your\njacket.\"\n\nThe master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of\nswitches notably diminished. Then the order followed:\n\n\"Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.\"\n\nThe titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but\nin reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of\nhis unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good\nfortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl\nhitched herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks\nand whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon\nthe long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.\n\nBy and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur\nrose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal\nfurtive glances at the girl. She observed it, \"made a mouth\" at him and\ngave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she\ncautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it\naway. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less\nanimosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it\nremain. Tom scrawled on his slate, \"Please take it--I got more.\" The\ngirl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw\nsomething on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time\nthe girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began to\nmanifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,\napparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt to\nsee, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she\ngave in and hesitatingly whispered:\n\n\"Let me see it.\"\n\nTom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable\nends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the\ngirl's interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot\neverything else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then\nwhispered:\n\n\"It's nice--make a man.\"\n\nThe artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick.\nHe could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not\nhypercritical; she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:\n\n\"It's a beautiful man--now make me coming along.\"\n\nTom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and\narmed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:\n\n\"It's ever so nice--I wish I could draw.\"\n\n\"It's easy,\" whispered Tom, \"I'll learn you.\"\n\n\"Oh, will you? When?\"\n\n\"At noon. Do you go home to dinner?\"\n\n\"I'll stay if you will.\"\n\n\"Good--that's a whack. What's your name?\"\n\n\"Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas Sawyer.\"\n\n\"That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You call me\nTom, will you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nNow Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from\nthe girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom\nsaid:\n\n\"Oh, it ain't anything.\"\n\n\"Yes it is.\"\n\n\"No it ain't. You don't want to see.\"\n\n\"Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.\"\n\n\"You'll tell.\"\n\n\"No I won't--deed and deed and double deed won't.\"\n\n\"You won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?\"\n\n\"No, I won't ever tell ANYbody. Now let me.\"\n\n\"Oh, YOU don't want to see!\"\n\n\"Now that you treat me so, I WILL see.\" And she put her small hand\nupon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in\nearnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were\nrevealed: \"I LOVE YOU.\"\n\n\"Oh, you bad thing!\" And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened\nand looked pleased, nevertheless.\n\nJust at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his\near, and a steady lifting impulse. In that vise he was borne across the\nhouse and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles\nfrom the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few\nawful moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a\nword. But although Tom's ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.\n\nAs the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but the\nturmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the\nreading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and\nturned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into\ncontinents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and\ngot \"turned down,\" by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought\nup at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with\nostentation for months.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his\nideas wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It\nseemed to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was\nutterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of\nsleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying\nscholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees.\nAway off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green\nsides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of\ndistance; a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other\nliving thing was visible but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom's\nheart ached to be free, or else to have something of interest to do to\npass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his face\nlit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know\nit. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the\ntick and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed\nwith a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it\nwas premature: for when he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned\nhim aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.\n\nTom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and\nnow he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an\ninstant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn\nfriends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a\npin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.\nThe sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were\ninterfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit of\nthe tick. So he put Joe's slate on the desk and drew a line down the\nmiddle of it from top to bottom.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and\nI'll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,\nyou're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.\"\n\n\"All right, go ahead; start him up.\"\n\nThe tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe\nharassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This\nchange of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with\nabsorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong,\nthe two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to\nall things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The\ntick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as\nanxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would\nhave victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would be\ntwitching to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep\npossession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was\ntoo strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was\nangry in a moment. Said he:\n\n\"Tom, you let him alone.\"\n\n\"I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.\"\n\n\"No, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone.\"\n\n\"Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much.\"\n\n\"Let him alone, I tell you.\"\n\n\"I won't!\"\n\n\"You shall--he's on my side of the line.\"\n\n\"Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?\"\n\n\"I don't care whose tick he is--he's on my side of the line, and you\nsha'n't touch him.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do what I\nblame please with him, or die!\"\n\nA tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders, and its duplicate on\nJoe's; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from\nthe two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been too\nabsorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile\nbefore when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over\nthem. He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he\ncontributed his bit of variety to it.\n\nWhen school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and\nwhispered in her ear:\n\n\"Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you get to\nthe corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down through the\nlane and come back. I'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same\nway.\"\n\nSo the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with\nanother. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and\nwhen they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they\nsat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil\nand held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising\nhouse. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.\nTom was swimming in bliss. He said:\n\n\"Do you love rats?\"\n\n\"No! I hate them!\"\n\n\"Well, I do, too--LIVE ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your\nhead with a string.\"\n\n\"No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.\"\n\n\"Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.\"\n\n\"Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you must give\nit back to me.\"\n\nThat was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their\nlegs against the bench in excess of contentment.\n\n\"Was you ever at a circus?\" said Tom.\n\n\"Yes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm good.\"\n\n\"I been to the circus three or four times--lots of times. Church ain't\nshucks to a circus. There's things going on at a circus all the time.\nI'm going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.\"\n\n\"Oh, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all spotted up.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's so. And they get slathers of money--most a dollar a day,\nBen Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Why, engaged to be married.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Would you like to?\"\n\n\"I reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?\"\n\n\"Like? Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you won't\never have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that's\nall. Anybody can do it.\"\n\n\"Kiss? What do you kiss for?\"\n\n\"Why, that, you know, is to--well, they always do that.\"\n\n\"Everybody?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you remember\nwhat I wrote on the slate?\"\n\n\"Ye--yes.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"I sha'n't tell you.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell YOU?\"\n\n\"Ye--yes--but some other time.\"\n\n\"No, now.\"\n\n\"No, not now--to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, NOW. Please, Becky--I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it ever so\neasy.\"\n\nBecky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm\nabout her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth\nclose to her ear. And then he added:\n\n\"Now you whisper it to me--just the same.\"\n\nShe resisted, for a while, and then said:\n\n\"You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But you\nmustn't ever tell anybody--WILL you, Tom? Now you won't, WILL you?\"\n\n\"No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky.\"\n\nHe turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath\nstirred his curls and whispered, \"I--love--you!\"\n\nThen she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,\nwith Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her\nlittle white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and\npleaded:\n\n\"Now, Becky, it's all done--all over but the kiss. Don't you be afraid\nof that--it ain't anything at all. Please, Becky.\" And he tugged at her\napron and the hands.\n\nBy and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing\nwith the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and\nsaid:\n\n\"Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain't\never to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to marry anybody but\nme, ever never and forever. Will you?\"\n\n\"No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never marry\nanybody but you--and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me, either.\"\n\n\"Certainly. Of course. That's PART of it. And always coming to school\nor when we're going home, you're to walk with me, when there ain't\nanybody looking--and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because\nthat's the way you do when you're engaged.\"\n\n\"It's so nice. I never heard of it before.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence--\"\n\nThe big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.\n\n\"Oh, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to!\"\n\nThe child began to cry. Tom said:\n\n\"Oh, don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do, Tom--you know you do.\"\n\nTom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and\nturned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with\nsoothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was\nup, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and\nuneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping\nshe would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began\nto feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle\nwith him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and\nentered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with\nher face to the wall. Tom's heart smote him. He went to her and stood a\nmoment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:\n\n\"Becky, I--I don't care for anybody but you.\"\n\nNo reply--but sobs.\n\n\"Becky\"--pleadingly. \"Becky, won't you say something?\"\n\nMore sobs.\n\nTom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an\nandiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:\n\n\"Please, Becky, won't you take it?\"\n\nShe struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over\nthe hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently\nBecky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she\nflew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:\n\n\"Tom! Come back, Tom!\"\n\nShe listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions\nbut silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid\nherself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she\nhad to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross\nof a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers\nabout her to exchange sorrows with.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of\nthe track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He\ncrossed a small \"branch\" two or three times, because of a prevailing\njuvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour\nlater he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of\nCardiff Hill, and the schoolhouse was hardly distinguishable away off\nin the valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless\nway to the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading\noak. There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had\neven stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was\nbroken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a\nwoodpecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense\nof loneliness the more profound. The boy's soul was steeped in\nmelancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings. He\nsat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands,\nmeditating. It seemed to him that life was but a trouble, at best, and\nhe more than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released; it must be\nvery peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream forever and\never, with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the\ngrass and the flowers over the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve\nabout, ever any more. If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he\ncould be willing to go, and be done with it all. Now as to this girl.\nWhat had he done? Nothing. He had meant the best in the world, and been\ntreated like a dog--like a very dog. She would be sorry some day--maybe\nwhen it was too late. Ah, if he could only die TEMPORARILY!\n\nBut the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one\nconstrained shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift\ninsensibly back into the concerns of this life again. What if he turned\nhis back, now, and disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away--ever\nso far away, into unknown countries beyond the seas--and never came\nback any more! How would she feel then! The idea of being a clown\nrecurred to him now, only to fill him with disgust. For frivolity and\njokes and spotted tights were an offense, when they intruded themselves\nupon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the\nromantic. No, he would be a soldier, and return after long years, all\nwar-worn and illustrious. No--better still, he would join the Indians,\nand hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the\ntrackless great plains of the Far West, and away in the future come\nback a great chief, bristling with feathers, hideous with paint, and\nprance into Sunday-school, some drowsy summer morning, with a\nbloodcurdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs of all his companions\nwith unappeasable envy. But no, there was something gaudier even than\nthis. He would be a pirate! That was it! NOW his future lay plain\nbefore him, and glowing with unimaginable splendor. How his name would\nfill the world, and make people shudder! How gloriously he would go\nplowing the dancing seas, in his long, low, black-hulled racer, the\nSpirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying at the fore! And at\nthe zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear at the old village\nand stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in his black velvet\ndoublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson sash, his belt\nbristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his\nslouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the skull\nand crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings,\n\"It's Tom Sawyer the Pirate!--the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!\"\n\nYes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from\nhome and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore\nhe must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources\ntogether. He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under\none end of it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded\nhollow. He put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:\n\n\"What hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!\"\n\nThen he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it\nup and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides\nwere of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom's astonishment was boundless!\nHe scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:\n\n\"Well, that beats anything!\"\n\nThen he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The\ntruth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and\nall his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried a\nmarble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a\nfortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just\nused, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had\ngathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they\nhad been separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably\nfailed. Tom's whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations.\nHe had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its\nfailing before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several\ntimes before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places\nafterward. He puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided\nthat some witch had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he\nwould satisfy himself on that point; so he searched around till he\nfound a small sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it.\nHe laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and\ncalled--\n\n\"Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,\ndoodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!\"\n\nThe sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a\nsecond and then darted under again in a fright.\n\n\"He dasn't tell! So it WAS a witch that done it. I just knowed it.\"\n\nHe well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he\ngave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have\nthe marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a\npatient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to\nhis treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been\nstanding when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble\nfrom his pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:\n\n\"Brother, go find your brother!\"\n\nHe watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must\nhave fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last\nrepetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each\nother.\n\nJust here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green\naisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a\nsuspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,\ndisclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and in\na moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged, with\nfluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an\nanswering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way\nand that. He said cautiously--to an imaginary company:\n\n\"Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.\"\n\nNow appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.\nTom called:\n\n\"Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?\"\n\n\"Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou that--that--\"\n\n\"Dares to hold such language,\" said Tom, prompting--for they talked\n\"by the book,\" from memory.\n\n\"Who art thou that dares to hold such language?\"\n\n\"I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.\"\n\n\"Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute\nwith thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!\"\n\nThey took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,\nstruck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful\ncombat, \"two up and two down.\" Presently Tom said:\n\n\"Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!\"\n\nSo they \"went it lively,\" panting and perspiring with the work. By and\nby Tom shouted:\n\n\"Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?\"\n\n\"I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the worst of\nit.\"\n\n\"Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in\nthe book. The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor\nGuy of Guisborne.' You're to turn around and let me hit you in the\nback.\"\n\nThere was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received\nthe whack and fell.\n\n\"Now,\" said Joe, getting up, \"you got to let me kill YOU. That's fair.\"\n\n\"Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book.\"\n\n\"Well, it's blamed mean--that's all.\"\n\n\"Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son, and\nlam me with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and\nyou be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.\"\n\nThis was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then\nTom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to\nbleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,\nrepresenting a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,\ngave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, \"Where this arrow\nfalls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.\" Then he\nshot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a\nnettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.\n\nThe boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off\ngrieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern\ncivilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.\nThey said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than\nPresident of the United States forever.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nAT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.\nThey said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and\nwaited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be\nnearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He\nwould have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was\nafraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.\nEverything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,\nscarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking\nof the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to\ncrack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were\nabroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly's chamber. And\nnow the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could\nlocate, began. Next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall at\nthe bed's head made Tom shudder--it meant that somebody's days were\nnumbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was\nanswered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an\nagony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity\nbegun; he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven,\nbut he did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his\nhalf-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a\nneighboring window disturbed him. A cry of \"Scat! you devil!\" and the\ncrash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt's woodshed\nbrought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and\nout of the window and creeping along the roof of the \"ell\" on all\nfours. He \"meow'd\" with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped\nto the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn\nwas there, with his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the\ngloom. At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall\ngrass of the graveyard.\n\nIt was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a\nhill, about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board\nfence around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of\nthe time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the\nwhole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a\ntombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over\nthe graves, leaning for support and finding none. \"Sacred to the memory\nof\" So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer\nhave been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.\n\nA faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the\nspirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked\nlittle, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the\npervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the\nsharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the\nprotection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet\nof the grave.\n\nThen they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting\nof a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness.\nTom's reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said\nin a whisper:\n\n\"Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?\"\n\nHuckleberry whispered:\n\n\"I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, AIN'T it?\"\n\n\"I bet it is.\"\n\nThere was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter\ninwardly. Then Tom whispered:\n\n\"Say, Hucky--do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?\"\n\n\"O' course he does. Least his sperrit does.\"\n\nTom, after a pause:\n\n\"I wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm.\nEverybody calls him Hoss.\"\n\n\"A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead\npeople, Tom.\"\n\nThis was a damper, and conversation died again.\n\nPresently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said:\n\n\"Sh!\"\n\n\"What is it, Tom?\" And the two clung together with beating hearts.\n\n\"Sh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"There! Now you hear it.\"\n\n\"Lord, Tom, they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we do?\"\n\n\"I dono. Think they'll see us?\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn't\ncome.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be afeard. I don't believe they'll bother us. We ain't\ndoing any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't notice us\nat all.\"\n\n\"I'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver.\"\n\n\"Listen!\"\n\nThe boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled\nsound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.\n\n\"Look! See there!\" whispered Tom. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.\"\n\nSome vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an\nold-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable\nlittle spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a\nshudder:\n\n\"It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're goners!\nCan you pray?\"\n\n\"I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us. 'Now\nI lay me down to sleep, I--'\"\n\n\"Sh!\"\n\n\"What is it, Huck?\"\n\n\"They're HUMANS! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff Potter's\nvoice.\"\n\n\"No--'tain't so, is it?\"\n\n\"I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp enough to\nnotice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely--blamed old rip!\"\n\n\"All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it. Here\nthey come again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot!\nThey're p'inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o' them\nvoices; it's Injun Joe.\"\n\n\"That's so--that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was devils a\ndern sight. What kin they be up to?\"\n\nThe whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the\ngrave and stood within a few feet of the boys' hiding-place.\n\n\"Here it is,\" said the third voice; and the owner of it held the\nlantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.\n\nPotter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a\ncouple of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open\nthe grave. The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came\nand sat down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so\nclose the boys could have touched him.\n\n\"Hurry, men!\" he said, in a low voice; \"the moon might come out at any\nmoment.\"\n\nThey growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was\nno noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight\nof mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck\nupon the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or\ntwo the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid\nwith their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the\nground. The moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid\nface. The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered\nwith a blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a\nlarge spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then\nsaid:\n\n\"Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out with\nanother five, or here she stays.\"\n\n\"That's the talk!\" said Injun Joe.\n\n\"Look here, what does this mean?\" said the doctor. \"You required your\npay in advance, and I've paid you.\"\n\n\"Yes, and you done more than that,\" said Injun Joe, approaching the\ndoctor, who was now standing. \"Five years ago you drove me away from\nyour father's kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to\neat, and you said I warn't there for any good; and when I swore I'd get\neven with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for\na vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The Injun blood ain't in me for\nnothing. And now I've GOT you, and you got to SETTLE, you know!\"\n\nHe was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this\ntime. The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the\nground. Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:\n\n\"Here, now, don't you hit my pard!\" and the next moment he had\ngrappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and\nmain, trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels.\nInjun Joe sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched\nup Potter's knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and\nround about the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the\ndoctor flung himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams'\ngrave and felled Potter to the earth with it--and in the same instant\nthe half-breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the\nyoung man's breast. He reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him\nwith his blood, and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the\ndreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in\nthe dark.\n\nPresently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over\nthe two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately,\ngave a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:\n\n\"THAT score is settled--damn you.\"\n\nThen he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in\nPotter's open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three\n--four--five minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His\nhand closed upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it\nfall, with a shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and\ngazed at it, and then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe's.\n\n\"Lord, how is this, Joe?\" he said.\n\n\"It's a dirty business,\" said Joe, without moving.\n\n\"What did you do it for?\"\n\n\"I! I never done it!\"\n\n\"Look here! That kind of talk won't wash.\"\n\nPotter trembled and grew white.\n\n\"I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But it's\nin my head yet--worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle;\ncan't recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe--HONEST, now, old\nfeller--did I do it? Joe, I never meant to--'pon my soul and honor, I\nnever meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it's awful--and him\nso young and promising.\"\n\n\"Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard\nand you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering\nlike, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched\nyou another awful clip--and here you've laid, as dead as a wedge til\nnow.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if\nI did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I\nreckon. I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I've fought, but\nnever with weepons. They'll all say that. Joe, don't tell! Say you\nwon't tell, Joe--that's a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and\nstood up for you, too. Don't you remember? You WON'T tell, WILL you,\nJoe?\" And the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid\nmurderer, and clasped his appealing hands.\n\n\"No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I\nwon't go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can say.\"\n\n\"Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest day I\nlive.\" And Potter began to cry.\n\n\"Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering.\nYou be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and don't leave any\ntracks behind you.\"\n\nPotter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The\nhalf-breed stood looking after him. He muttered:\n\n\"If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he\nhad the look of being, he won't think of the knife till he's gone so\nfar he'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself\n--chicken-heart!\"\n\nTwo or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the\nlidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the\nmoon's. The stillness was complete again, too.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with\nhorror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,\napprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump\nthat started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them\ncatch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay\nnear the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give\nwings to their feet.\n\n\"If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!\"\nwhispered Tom, in short catches between breaths. \"I can't stand it much\nlonger.\"\n\nHuckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed\ntheir eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.\nThey gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst\nthrough the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering\nshadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:\n\n\"Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?\"\n\n\"If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it.\"\n\n\"Do you though?\"\n\n\"Why, I KNOW it, Tom.\"\n\nTom thought a while, then he said:\n\n\"Who'll tell? We?\"\n\n\"What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun Joe\nDIDN'T hang? Why, he'd kill us some time or other, just as dead sure as\nwe're a laying here.\"\n\n\"That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.\"\n\n\"If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough. He's\ngenerally drunk enough.\"\n\nTom said nothing--went on thinking. Presently he whispered:\n\n\"Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?\"\n\n\"What's the reason he don't know it?\"\n\n\"Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you reckon\nhe could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed anything?\"\n\n\"By hokey, that's so, Tom!\"\n\n\"And besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for HIM!\"\n\n\"No, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and\nbesides, he always has. Well, when pap's full, you might take and belt\nhim over the head with a church and you couldn't phase him. He says so,\nhis own self. So it's the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a\nman was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.\"\n\nAfter another reflective silence, Tom said:\n\n\"Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?\"\n\n\"Tom, we GOT to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn't\nmake any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to\nsqueak 'bout this and they didn't hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less\ntake and swear to one another--that's what we got to do--swear to keep\nmum.\"\n\n\"I'm agreed. It's the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear\nthat we--\"\n\n\"Oh no, that wouldn't do for this. That's good enough for little\nrubbishy common things--specially with gals, cuz THEY go back on you\nanyway, and blab if they get in a huff--but there orter be writing\n'bout a big thing like this. And blood.\"\n\nTom's whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and\nawful; the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping\nwith it. He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moonlight,\ntook a little fragment of \"red keel\" out of his pocket, got the moon on\nhis work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow\ndown-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up\nthe pressure on the up-strokes. [See next page.]\n\n   \"Huck Finn and\n    Tom Sawyer swears\n    they will keep mum\n    about This and They\n    wish They may Drop\n    down dead in Their\n    Tracks if They ever\n    Tell and Rot.\"\n\nHuckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in writing,\nand the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel\nand was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:\n\n\"Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have verdigrease on\nit.\"\n\n\"What's verdigrease?\"\n\n\"It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it once\n--you'll see.\"\n\nSo Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy\npricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In\ntime, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the\nball of his little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to\nmake an H and an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle\nclose to the wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and\nthe fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and\nthe key thrown away.\n\nA figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the\nruined building, now, but they did not notice it.\n\n\"Tom,\" whispered Huckleberry, \"does this keep us from EVER telling\n--ALWAYS?\"\n\n\"Of course it does. It don't make any difference WHAT happens, we got\nto keep mum. We'd drop down dead--don't YOU know that?\"\n\n\"Yes, I reckon that's so.\"\n\nThey continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up\na long, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them. The boys\nclasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.\n\n\"Which of us does he mean?\" gasped Huckleberry.\n\n\"I dono--peep through the crack. Quick!\"\n\n\"No, YOU, Tom!\"\n\n\"I can't--I can't DO it, Huck!\"\n\n\"Please, Tom. There 'tis again!\"\n\n\"Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!\" whispered Tom. \"I know his voice. It's Bull\nHarbison.\" *\n\n[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of\nhim as \"Harbison's Bull,\" but a son or a dog of that name was \"Bull\nHarbison.\"]\n\n\"Oh, that's good--I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I'd a\nbet anything it was a STRAY dog.\"\n\nThe dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.\n\n\"Oh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!\" whispered Huckleberry. \"DO, Tom!\"\n\nTom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His\nwhisper was hardly audible when he said:\n\n\"Oh, Huck, IT S A STRAY DOG!\"\n\n\"Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?\"\n\n\"Huck, he must mean us both--we're right together.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no mistake 'bout\nwhere I'LL go to. I been so wicked.\"\n\n\"Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a\nfeller's told NOT to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I'd a tried\n--but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if ever I get off this time, I lay\nI'll just WALLER in Sunday-schools!\" And Tom began to snuffle a little.\n\n\"YOU bad!\" and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. \"Consound it, Tom\nSawyer, you're just old pie, 'longside o' what I am. Oh, LORDY, lordy,\nlordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.\"\n\nTom choked off and whispered:\n\n\"Look, Hucky, look! He's got his BACK to us!\"\n\nHucky looked, with joy in his heart.\n\n\"Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?\"\n\n\"Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully,\nyou know. NOW who can he mean?\"\n\nThe howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.\n\n\"Sh! What's that?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Sounds like--like hogs grunting. No--it's somebody snoring, Tom.\"\n\n\"That IS it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?\"\n\n\"I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to\nsleep there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he\njust lifts things when HE snores. Besides, I reckon he ain't ever\ncoming back to this town any more.\"\n\nThe spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.\n\n\"Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?\"\n\n\"I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!\"\n\nTom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the\nboys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to\ntheir heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily\ndown, the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps\nof the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap.\nThe man moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight.\nIt was Muff Potter. The boys' hearts had stood still, and their hopes\ntoo, when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tiptoed\nout, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little\ndistance to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on\nthe night air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing\nwithin a few feet of where Potter was lying, and FACING Potter, with\nhis nose pointing heavenward.\n\n\"Oh, geeminy, it's HIM!\" exclaimed both boys, in a breath.\n\n\"Say, Tom--they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller's\nhouse, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill\ncome in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and\nthere ain't anybody dead there yet.\"\n\n\"Well, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie Miller fall\nin the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?\"\n\n\"Yes, but she ain't DEAD. And what's more, she's getting better, too.\"\n\n\"All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure as Muff\nPotter's a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they know all about\nthese kind of things, Huck.\"\n\nThen they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom\nwindow the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution,\nand fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his\nescapade. He was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and\nhad been so for an hour.\n\nWhen Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the\nlight, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not\nbeen called--persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled\nhim with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,\nfeeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had\nfinished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were\naverted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a\nchill to the culprit's heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it\nwas up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into\nsilence and let his heart sink down to the depths.\n\nAfter breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in\nthe hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt\nwept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;\nand finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray\nhairs with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any\nmore. This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom's heart was\nsorer now than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised\nto reform over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling\nthat he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a\nfeeble confidence.\n\nHe left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward Sid;\nand so the latter's prompt retreat through the back gate was\nunnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,\nalong with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the air\nof one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to\ntrifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his\ndesk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony\nstare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.\nHis elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time\nhe slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with\na sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal\nsigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!\n\nThis final feather broke the camel's back.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nCLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified\nwith the ghastly news. No need of the as yet undreamed-of telegraph;\nthe tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to\nhouse, with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the\nschoolmaster gave holiday for that afternoon; the town would have\nthought strangely of him if he had not.\n\nA gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been\nrecognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter--so the story ran.\nAnd it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing\nhimself in the \"branch\" about one or two o'clock in the morning, and\nthat Potter had at once sneaked off--suspicious circumstances,\nespecially the washing which was not a habit with Potter. It was also\nsaid that the town had been ransacked for this \"murderer\" (the public\nare not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a\nverdict), but that he could not be found. Horsemen had departed down\nall the roads in every direction, and the Sheriff \"was confident\" that\nhe would be captured before night.\n\nAll the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom's heartbreak\nvanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not a\nthousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,\nunaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place,\nhe wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal\nspectacle. It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody\npinched his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry's. Then both\nlooked elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything\nin their mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the\ngrisly spectacle before them.\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" \"Poor young fellow!\" \"This ought to be a lesson to\ngrave robbers!\" \"Muff Potter'll hang for this if they catch him!\" This\nwas the drift of remark; and the minister said, \"It was a judgment; His\nhand is here.\"\n\nNow Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid\nface of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,\nand voices shouted, \"It's him! it's him! he's coming himself!\"\n\n\"Who? Who?\" from twenty voices.\n\n\"Muff Potter!\"\n\n\"Hallo, he's stopped!--Look out, he's turning! Don't let him get away!\"\n\nPeople in the branches of the trees over Tom's head said he wasn't\ntrying to get away--he only looked doubtful and perplexed.\n\n\"Infernal impudence!\" said a bystander; \"wanted to come and take a\nquiet look at his work, I reckon--didn't expect any company.\"\n\nThe crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through,\nostentatiously leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow's face was\nhaggard, and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood\nbefore the murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face\nin his hands and burst into tears.\n\n\"I didn't do it, friends,\" he sobbed; \"'pon my word and honor I never\ndone it.\"\n\n\"Who's accused you?\" shouted a voice.\n\nThis shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked\naround him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe,\nand exclaimed:\n\n\"Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you'd never--\"\n\n\"Is that your knife?\" and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.\n\nPotter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to\nthe ground. Then he said:\n\n\"Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get--\" He shuddered;\nthen waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, \"Tell\n'em, Joe, tell 'em--it ain't any use any more.\"\n\nThen Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the\nstony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every\nmoment that the clear sky would deliver God's lightnings upon his head,\nand wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had\nfinished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to\nbreak their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner's life faded and\nvanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and\nit would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.\n\n\"Why didn't you leave? What did you want to come here for?\" somebody\nsaid.\n\n\"I couldn't help it--I couldn't help it,\" Potter moaned. \"I wanted to\nrun away, but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but here.\" And he fell\nto sobbing again.\n\nInjun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes\nafterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the\nlightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that Joe\nhad sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most\nbalefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could\nnot take their fascinated eyes from his face.\n\nThey inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should\noffer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.\n\nInjun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a\nwagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd\nthat the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy\ncircumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were\ndisappointed, for more than one villager remarked:\n\n\"It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.\"\n\nTom's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as\nmuch as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:\n\n\"Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me\nawake half the time.\"\n\nTom blanched and dropped his eyes.\n\n\"It's a bad sign,\" said Aunt Polly, gravely. \"What you got on your\nmind, Tom?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Nothing 't I know of.\" But the boy's hand shook so that he\nspilled his coffee.\n\n\"And you do talk such stuff,\" Sid said. \"Last night you said, 'It's\nblood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and over. And\nyou said, 'Don't torment me so--I'll tell!' Tell WHAT? What is it\nyou'll tell?\"\n\nEverything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might\nhave happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly's\nface and she came to Tom's relief without knowing it. She said:\n\n\"Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night\nmyself. Sometimes I dream it's me that done it.\"\n\nMary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed\nsatisfied. Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could,\nand after that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his\njaws every night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and\nfrequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow\nlistening a good while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage\nback to its place again. Tom's distress of mind wore off gradually and\nthe toothache grew irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to\nmake anything out of Tom's disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.\n\nIt seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding\ninquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his\nmind. Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,\nthough it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;\nhe noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness--and that was\nstrange; and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a\nmarked aversion to these inquests, and always avoided them when he\ncould. Sid marvelled, but said nothing. However, even inquests went out\nof vogue at last, and ceased to torture Tom's conscience.\n\nEvery day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his\nopportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such\nsmall comforts through to the \"murderer\" as he could get hold of. The\njail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge\nof the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it was\nseldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom's\nconscience.\n\nThe villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and\nride him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his\ncharacter that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead\nin the matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of\nhis inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the\ngrave-robbery that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not\nto try the case in the courts at present.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nONE of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its secret\ntroubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest\nitself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had\nstruggled with his pride a few days, and tried to \"whistle her down the\nwind,\" but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father's\nhouse, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she\nshould die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an\ninterest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there\nwas nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;\nthere was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to\ntry all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who are\ninfatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of\nproducing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in\nthese things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a\nfever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,\nbut on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the\n\"Health\" periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance\nthey were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the \"rot\" they\ncontained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,\nand what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and\nwhat frame of mind to keep one's self in, and what sort of clothing to\nwear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her\nhealth-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they\nhad recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest\nas the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered\ntogether her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed\nwith death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with\n\"hell following after.\" But she never suspected that she was not an\nangel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering\nneighbors.\n\nThe water treatment was new, now, and Tom's low condition was a\nwindfall to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him\nup in the woodshed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then\nshe scrubbed him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to;\nthen she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets\ntill she sweated his soul clean and \"the yellow stains of it came\nthrough his pores\"--as Tom said.\n\nYet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy\nand pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths,\nand plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to\nassist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She\ncalculated his capacity as she would a jug's, and filled him up every\nday with quack cure-alls.\n\nTom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase\nfilled the old lady's heart with consternation. This indifference must\nbe broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first\ntime. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with\ngratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water\ntreatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer. She\ngave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the\nresult. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;\nfor the \"indifference\" was broken up. The boy could not have shown a\nwilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.\n\nTom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be\nromantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have\ntoo little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he\nthought over various plans for relief, and finally hit pon that of\nprofessing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he\nbecame a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself\nand quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no\nmisgivings to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the\nbottle clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish,\nbut it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a\ncrack in the sitting-room floor with it.\n\nOne day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's yellow\ncat came along, purring, eying the teaspoon avariciously, and begging\nfor a taste. Tom said:\n\n\"Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter.\"\n\nBut Peter signified that he did want it.\n\n\"You better make sure.\"\n\nPeter was sure.\n\n\"Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't\nanything mean about me; but if you find you don't like it, you mustn't\nblame anybody but your own self.\"\n\nPeter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the\nPain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then\ndelivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging\nagainst furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc.\nNext he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of\nenjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming\nhis unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again\nspreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time\nto see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty\nhurrah, and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the\nflower-pots with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment,\npeering over her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.\n\n\"Tom, what on earth ails that cat?\"\n\n\"I don't know, aunt,\" gasped the boy.\n\n\"Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?\"\n\n\"Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're having\na good time.\"\n\n\"They do, do they?\" There was something in the tone that made Tom\napprehensive.\n\n\"Yes'm. That is, I believe they do.\"\n\n\"You DO?\"\n\n\"Yes'm.\"\n\nThe old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized\nby anxiety. Too late he divined her \"drift.\" The handle of the telltale\nteaspoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it\nup. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the\nusual handle--his ear--and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.\n\n\"Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?\"\n\n\"I done it out of pity for him--because he hadn't any aunt.\"\n\n\"Hadn't any aunt!--you numskull. What has that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"Heaps. Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt him out herself! She'd a\nroasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling than if he was a\nhuman!\"\n\nAunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing\nin a new light; what was cruelty to a cat MIGHT be cruelty to a boy,\ntoo. She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little,\nand she put her hand on Tom's head and said gently:\n\n\"I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it DID do you good.\"\n\nTom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping\nthrough his gravity.\n\n\"I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter.\nIt done HIM good, too. I never see him get around so since--\"\n\n\"Oh, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you\ntry and see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you needn't take\nany more medicine.\"\n\nTom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange\nthing had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,\nhe hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his\ncomrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to\nbe looking everywhere but whither he really was looking--down the road.\nPresently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom's face lighted; he gazed\na moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom\naccosted him; and \"led up\" warily to opportunities for remark about\nBecky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and\nwatched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the\nowner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks\nceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered\nthe empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock\npassed in at the gate, and Tom's heart gave a great bound. The next\ninstant he was out, and \"going on\" like an Indian; yelling, laughing,\nchasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing\nhandsprings, standing on his head--doing all the heroic things he could\nconceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if\nBecky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it\nall; she never looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that\nhe was there? He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came\nwar-whooping around, snatched a boy's cap, hurled it to the roof of the\nschoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every\ndirection, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky's nose, almost\nupsetting her--and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard\nher say: \"Mf! some people think they're mighty smart--always showing\noff!\"\n\nTom's cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed\nand crestfallen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTOM'S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a\nforsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found\nout what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had\ntried to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since\nnothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them\nblame HIM for the consequences--why shouldn't they? What right had the\nfriendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he\nwould lead a life of crime. There was no choice.\n\nBy this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to\n\"take up\" tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he\nshould never, never hear that old familiar sound any more--it was very\nhard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold\nworld, he must submit--but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick\nand fast.\n\nJust at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe Harper\n--hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart.\nPlainly here were \"two souls with but a single thought.\" Tom, wiping\nhis eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about a\nresolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by\nroaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by\nhoping that Joe would not forget him.\n\nBut it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been\ngoing to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His\nmother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never\ntasted and knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him\nand wished him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him\nto do but succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having\ndriven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.\n\nAs the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to\nstand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death\nrelieved them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans.\nJoe was for being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and\ndying, some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to\nTom, he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a\nlife of crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.\n\nThree miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi\nRiver was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded\nisland, with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as\na rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further\nshore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson's\nIsland was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a\nmatter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry\nFinn, and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he\nwas indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on\nthe river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour--which\nwas midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to\ncapture. Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he\ncould steal in the most dark and mysterious way--as became outlaws. And\nbefore the afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet\nglory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would \"hear\nsomething.\" All who got this vague hint were cautioned to \"be mum and\nwait.\"\n\nAbout midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,\nand stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the\nmeeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay\nlike an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the\nquiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under\nthe bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the\nsame way. Then a guarded voice said:\n\n\"Who goes there?\"\n\n\"Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.\"\n\n\"Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.\" Tom\nhad furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.\n\n\"'Tis well. Give the countersign.\"\n\nTwo hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to\nthe brooding night:\n\n\"BLOOD!\"\n\nThen Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,\ntearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was\nan easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it\nlacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.\n\nThe Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn\nhimself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a\nskillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought\na few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or\n\"chewed\" but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it\nwould never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;\nmatches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire\nsmouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went\nstealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an\nimposing adventure of it, saying, \"Hist!\" every now and then, and\nsuddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary\ndagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if \"the foe\"\nstirred, to \"let him have it to the hilt,\" because \"dead men tell no\ntales.\" They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the\nvillage laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was no\nexcuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.\n\nThey shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and\nJoe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded\narms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:\n\n\"Luff, and bring her to the wind!\"\n\n\"Aye-aye, sir!\"\n\n\"Steady, steady-y-y-y!\"\n\n\"Steady it is, sir!\"\n\n\"Let her go off a point!\"\n\n\"Point it is, sir!\"\n\nAs the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream\nit was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for\n\"style,\" and were not intended to mean anything in particular.\n\n\"What sail's she carrying?\"\n\n\"Courses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir.\"\n\n\"Send the r'yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of ye\n--foretopmaststuns'l! Lively, now!\"\n\n\"Aye-aye, sir!\"\n\n\"Shake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! NOW my hearties!\"\n\n\"Aye-aye, sir!\"\n\n\"Hellum-a-lee--hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,\nport! NOW, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!\"\n\n\"Steady it is, sir!\"\n\nThe raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her\nhead right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so\nthere was not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was\nsaid during the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was\npassing before the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed\nwhere it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of\nstar-gemmed water, unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening.\nThe Black Avenger stood still with folded arms, \"looking his last\" upon\nthe scene of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing\n\"she\" could see him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death\nwith dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips.\nIt was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson's Island\nbeyond eyeshot of the village, and so he \"looked his last\" with a\nbroken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last,\ntoo; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the\ncurrent drift them out of the range of the island. But they discovered\nthe danger in time, and made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in\nthe morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the\nhead of the island, and they waded back and forth until they had landed\ntheir freight. Part of the little raft's belongings consisted of an old\nsail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to\nshelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open\nair in good weather, as became outlaws.\n\nThey built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty\nsteps within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some\nbacon in the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn \"pone\"\nstock they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that\nwild, free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited\nisland, far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would\nreturn to civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw\nits ruddy glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple,\nand upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines.\n\nWhen the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance of\ncorn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,\nfilled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but they\nwould not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting\ncamp-fire.\n\n\"AIN'T it gay?\" said Joe.\n\n\"It's NUTS!\" said Tom. \"What would the boys say if they could see us?\"\n\n\"Say? Well, they'd just die to be here--hey, Hucky!\"\n\n\"I reckon so,\" said Huckleberry; \"anyways, I'm suited. I don't want\nnothing better'n this. I don't ever get enough to eat, gen'ally--and\nhere they can't come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.\"\n\n\"It's just the life for me,\" said Tom. \"You don't have to get up,\nmornings, and you don't have to go to school, and wash, and all that\nblame foolishness. You see a pirate don't have to do ANYTHING, Joe,\nwhen he's ashore, but a hermit HE has to be praying considerable, and\nthen he don't have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, that's so,\" said Joe, \"but I hadn't thought much about it,\nyou know. I'd a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I've tried it.\"\n\n\"You see,\" said Tom, \"people don't go much on hermits, nowadays, like\nthey used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected. And a\nhermit's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put\nsackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and--\"\n\n\"What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?\" inquired Huck.\n\n\"I dono. But they've GOT to do it. Hermits always do. You'd have to do\nthat if you was a hermit.\"\n\n\"Dern'd if I would,\" said Huck.\n\n\"Well, what would you do?\"\n\n\"I dono. But I wouldn't do that.\"\n\n\"Why, Huck, you'd HAVE to. How'd you get around it?\"\n\n\"Why, I just wouldn't stand it. I'd run away.\"\n\n\"Run away! Well, you WOULD be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You'd be\na disgrace.\"\n\nThe Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had\nfinished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded\nit with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a\ncloud of fragrant smoke--he was in the full bloom of luxurious\ncontentment. The other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and\nsecretly resolved to acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:\n\n\"What does pirates have to do?\"\n\nTom said:\n\n\"Oh, they have just a bully time--take ships and burn them, and get\nthe money and bury it in awful places in their island where there's\nghosts and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships--make\n'em walk a plank.\"\n\n\"And they carry the women to the island,\" said Joe; \"they don't kill\nthe women.\"\n\n\"No,\" assented Tom, \"they don't kill the women--they're too noble. And\nthe women's always beautiful, too.\n\n\"And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver\nand di'monds,\" said Joe, with enthusiasm.\n\n\"Who?\" said Huck.\n\n\"Why, the pirates.\"\n\nHuck scanned his own clothing forlornly.\n\n\"I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate,\" said he, with a\nregretful pathos in his voice; \"but I ain't got none but these.\"\n\nBut the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,\nafter they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand\nthat his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for\nwealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.\n\nGradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the\neyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the\nRed-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the\nweary. The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main\nhad more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers\ninwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority\nto make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to\nsay them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as\nthat, lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from\nheaven. Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge\nof sleep--but an intruder came, now, that would not \"down.\" It was\nconscience. They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing\nwrong to run away; and next they thought of the stolen meat, and then\nthe real torture came. They tried to argue it away by reminding\nconscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of\ntimes; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin\nplausibilities; it seemed to them, in the end, that there was no\ngetting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only\n\"hooking,\" while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain\nsimple stealing--and there was a command against that in the Bible. So\nthey inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business,\ntheir piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing.\nThen conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent\npirates fell peacefully to sleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nWHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and\nrubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the\ncool gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in\nthe deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred;\nnot a sound obtruded upon great Nature's meditation. Beaded dewdrops\nstood upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the\nfire, and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe\nand Huck still slept.\n\nNow, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently\nthe hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray of\nthe morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life\nmanifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to\nwork unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came\ncrawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air\nfrom time to time and \"sniffing around,\" then proceeding again--for he\nwas measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own\naccord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,\nby turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to\ngo elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its\ncurved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg and\nbegan a journey over him, his whole heart was glad--for that meant that\nhe was going to have a new suit of clothes--without the shadow of a\ndoubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,\nfrom nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled\nmanfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,\nand lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug\nclimbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to\nit and said, \"Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire,\nyour children's alone,\" and she took wing and went off to see about it\n--which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was\ncredulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its\nsimplicity more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at\nits ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against\nits body and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this\ntime. A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom's head,\nand trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of\nenjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and\nstopped on a twig almost within the boy's reach, cocked his head to one\nside and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel\nand a big fellow of the \"fox\" kind came skurrying along, sitting up at\nintervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had\nprobably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to\nbe afraid or not. All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long\nlances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near,\nand a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.\n\nTom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a\nshout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and\ntumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white\nsandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the\ndistance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a\nslight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only\ngratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge\nbetween them and civilization.\n\nThey came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and\nravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found\na spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad\noak or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a\nwildwood charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee.\nWhile Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to\nhold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank\nand threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had\nnot had time to get impatient before they were back again with some\nhandsome bass, a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish--provisions\nenough for quite a family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were\nastonished; for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did\nnot know that the quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is\ncaught the better he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce\nopen-air sleeping, open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient\nof hunger make, too.\n\nThey lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,\nand then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They\ntramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,\namong solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the\nground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came\nupon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.\n\nThey found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be\nastonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles\nlong and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to\nwas only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards\nwide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the\nmiddle of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too\nhungry to stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and\nthen threw themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon\nbegan to drag, and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded\nin the woods, and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the\nspirits of the boys. They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing\ncrept upon them. This took dim shape, presently--it was budding\nhomesickness. Even Finn the Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps\nand empty hogsheads. But they were all ashamed of their weakness, and\nnone was brave enough to speak his thought.\n\nFor some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar\nsound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a\nclock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound\nbecame more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,\nglanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude.\nThere was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen\nboom came floating down out of the distance.\n\n\"What is it!\" exclaimed Joe, under his breath.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Tom in a whisper.\n\n\"'Tain't thunder,\" said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, \"becuz thunder--\"\n\n\"Hark!\" said Tom. \"Listen--don't talk.\"\n\nThey waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom\ntroubled the solemn hush.\n\n\"Let's go and see.\"\n\nThey sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town.\nThey parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The\nlittle steam ferryboat was about a mile below the village, drifting\nwith the current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were\na great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the\nneighborhood of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what\nthe men in them were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst\nfrom the ferryboat's side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud,\nthat same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.\n\n\"I know now!\" exclaimed Tom; \"somebody's drownded!\"\n\n\"That's it!\" said Huck; \"they done that last summer, when Bill Turner\ngot drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes him\ncome up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put\nquicksilver in 'em and set 'em afloat, and wherever there's anybody\nthat's drownded, they'll float right there and stop.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've heard about that,\" said Joe. \"I wonder what makes the bread\ndo that.\"\n\n\"Oh, it ain't the bread, so much,\" said Tom; \"I reckon it's mostly\nwhat they SAY over it before they start it out.\"\n\n\"But they don't say anything over it,\" said Huck. \"I've seen 'em and\nthey don't.\"\n\n\"Well, that's funny,\" said Tom. \"But maybe they say it to themselves.\nOf COURSE they do. Anybody might know that.\"\n\nThe other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because\nan ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not be\nexpected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such\ngravity.\n\n\"By jings, I wish I was over there, now,\" said Joe.\n\n\"I do too\" said Huck \"I'd give heaps to know who it is.\"\n\nThe boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought\nflashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:\n\n\"Boys, I know who's drownded--it's us!\"\n\nThey felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they\nwere missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;\ntears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor\nlost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being\nindulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole\ntown, and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety\nwas concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after\nall.\n\nAs twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed\nbusiness and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They\nwere jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious\ntrouble they were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it,\nand then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying\nabout them; and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their\naccount were gratifying to look upon--from their point of view. But\nwhen the shadows of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to\ntalk, and sat gazing into the fire, with their minds evidently\nwandering elsewhere. The excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe\ncould not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not\nenjoying this fine frolic as much as they were. Misgivings came; they\ngrew troubled and unhappy; a sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by\nJoe timidly ventured upon a roundabout \"feeler\" as to how the others\nmight look upon a return to civilization--not right now, but--\n\nTom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined\nin with Tom, and the waverer quickly \"explained,\" and was glad to get\nout of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted homesickness\nclinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to\nrest for the moment.\n\nAs the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore. Joe\nfollowed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,\nwatching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,\nand went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung\nby the camp-fire. He picked up and inspected several large\nsemi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose\ntwo which seemed to suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully\nwrote something upon each of these with his \"red keel\"; one he rolled up\nand put in his jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe's hat and\nremoved it to a little distance from the owner. And he also put into the\nhat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value--among them\na lump of chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that\nkind of marbles known as a \"sure 'nough crystal.\" Then he tiptoed his\nway cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing,\nand straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nA FEW minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading\ntoward the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was\nhalf-way over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he\nstruck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam\nquartering upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he\nhad expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along\ntill he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his\njacket pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through\nthe woods, following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before\nten o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and\nsaw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank.\nEverything was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank,\nwatching with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four\nstrokes and climbed into the skiff that did \"yawl\" duty at the boat's\nstern. He laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.\n\nPresently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to \"cast\noff.\" A minute or two later the skiff's head was standing high up,\nagainst the boat's swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in\nhis success, for he knew it was the boat's last trip for the night. At\nthe end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom\nslipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards\ndownstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.\n\nHe flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his\naunt's back fence. He climbed over, approached the \"ell,\" and looked in\nat the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There sat\nAunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother, grouped together,\ntalking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the\ndoor. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then he\npressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing\ncautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might\nsqueeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,\nwarily.\n\n\"What makes the candle blow so?\" said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up.\n\"Why, that door's open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of\nstrange things now. Go 'long and shut it, Sid.\"\n\nTom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and \"breathed\"\nhimself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his\naunt's foot.\n\n\"But as I was saying,\" said Aunt Polly, \"he warn't BAD, so to say\n--only mischEEvous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He\nwarn't any more responsible than a colt. HE never meant any harm, and\nhe was the best-hearted boy that ever was\"--and she began to cry.\n\n\"It was just so with my Joe--always full of his devilment, and up to\nevery kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he\ncould be--and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking\nthat cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself\nbecause it was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never,\nnever, never, poor abused boy!\" And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart\nwould break.\n\n\"I hope Tom's better off where he is,\" said Sid, \"but if he'd been\nbetter in some ways--\"\n\n\"SID!\" Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye, though he could not\nsee it. \"Not a word against my Tom, now that he's gone! God'll take\ncare of HIM--never you trouble YOURself, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don't\nknow how to give him up! I don't know how to give him up! He was such a\ncomfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, 'most.\"\n\n\"The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away--Blessed be the name of\nthe Lord! But it's so hard--Oh, it's so hard! Only last Saturday my\nJoe busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him\nsprawling. Little did I know then, how soon--Oh, if it was to do over\nagain I'd hug him and bless him for it.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just\nexactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took\nand filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur\nwould tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom's head\nwith my thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he's out of all his\ntroubles now. And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach--\"\n\nBut this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely\ndown. Tom was snuffling, now, himself--and more in pity of himself than\nanybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word\nfor him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself\nthan ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt's\ngrief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with\njoy--and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to\nhis nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.\n\nHe went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was\nconjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;\nthen the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the\nmissing lads had promised that the village should \"hear something\"\nsoon; the wise-heads had \"put this and that together\" and decided that\nthe lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town\nbelow, presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged\nagainst the Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village\n--and then hope perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have\ndriven them home by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the\nsearch for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the\ndrowning must have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good\nswimmers, would otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday\nnight. If the bodies continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be\ngiven over, and the funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom\nshuddered.\n\nMrs. Harper gave a sobbing good-night and turned to go. Then with a\nmutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each\nother's arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly\nwas tender far beyond her wont, in her good-night to Sid and Mary. Sid\nsnuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.\n\nAunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so\nappealingly, and with such measureless love in her words and her old\ntrembling voice, that he was weltering in tears again, long before she\nwas through.\n\nHe had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making\nbroken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and\nturning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her\nsleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the\ncandle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full\nof pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the\ncandle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering. His\nface lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark\nhastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and\nstraightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.\n\nHe threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large\nthere, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was\ntenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and\nslept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped\ninto it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a\nmile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself\nstoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for\nthis was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture the\nskiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore\nlegitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be\nmade for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and\nentered the woods.\n\nHe sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep\nawake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far\nspent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the\nisland bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the\ngreat river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A\nlittle later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and\nheard Joe say:\n\n\"No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't desert. He\nknows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's too proud for\nthat sort of thing. He's up to something or other. Now I wonder what?\"\n\n\"Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?\"\n\nPretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain't\nback here to breakfast.\"\n\n\"Which he is!\" exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping\ngrandly into camp.\n\nA sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as\nthe boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his\nadventures. They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the\ntale was done. Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till\nnoon, and the other pirates got ready to fish and explore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nAFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the\nbar. They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a\nsoft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands.\nSometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They\nwere perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an English\nwalnut. They had a famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on\nFriday morning.\n\nAfter breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and\nchased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until\nthey were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal\nwater of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their\nlegs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.\nAnd now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each\nother's faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with\naverted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and\nstruggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all\nwent under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,\nsputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.\n\nWhen they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the\ndry, hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by\nand by break for the water again and go through the original\nperformance once more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked\nskin represented flesh-colored \"tights\" very fairly; so they drew a\nring in the sand and had a circus--with three clowns in it, for none\nwould yield this proudest post to his neighbor.\n\nNext they got their marbles and played \"knucks\" and \"ring-taw\" and\n\"keeps\" till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another\nswim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off\nhis trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his\nankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the\nprotection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he\nhad found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to\nrest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the \"dumps,\" and fell\nto gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay\ndrowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing \"BECKY\" in the sand with\nhis big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his\nweakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He\nerased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving\nthe other boys together and joining them.\n\nBut Joe's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so\nhomesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay\nvery near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,\nbut tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready\nto tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon,\nhe would have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of\ncheerfulness:\n\n\"I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll explore\nit again. They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you feel to light\non a rotten chest full of gold and silver--hey?\"\n\nBut it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.\nTom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was\ndiscouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking\nvery gloomy. Finally he said:\n\n\"Oh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so lonesome.\"\n\n\"Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by,\" said Tom. \"Just think of\nthe fishing that's here.\"\n\n\"I don't care for fishing. I want to go home.\"\n\n\"But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place anywhere.\"\n\n\"Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when there\nain't anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go home.\"\n\n\"Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.\"\n\n\"Yes, I DO want to see my mother--and you would, too, if you had one.\nI ain't any more baby than you are.\" And Joe snuffled a little.\n\n\"Well, we'll let the cry-baby go home to his mother, won't we, Huck?\nPoor thing--does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like\nit here, don't you, Huck? We'll stay, won't we?\"\n\nHuck said, \"Y-e-s\"--without any heart in it.\n\n\"I'll never speak to you again as long as I live,\" said Joe, rising.\n\"There now!\" And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.\n\n\"Who cares!\" said Tom. \"Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get\nlaughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't cry-babies.\nWe'll stay, won't we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can\nget along without him, per'aps.\"\n\nBut Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go\nsullenly on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see\nHuck eying Joe's preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an\nominous silence. Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade\noff toward the Illinois shore. Tom's heart began to sink. He glanced at\nHuck. Huck could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:\n\n\"I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now\nit'll be worse. Let's us go, too, Tom.\"\n\n\"I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.\"\n\n\"Tom, I better go.\"\n\n\"Well, go 'long--who's hendering you.\"\n\nHuck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:\n\n\"Tom, I wisht you'd come, too. Now you think it over. We'll wait for\nyou when we get to shore.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll wait a blame long time, that's all.\"\n\nHuck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a\nstrong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too.\nHe hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It\nsuddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He\nmade one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his\ncomrades, yelling:\n\n\"Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!\"\n\nThey presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they\nwere, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till at\nlast they saw the \"point\" he was driving at, and then they set up a\nwar-whoop of applause and said it was \"splendid!\" and said if he had\ntold them at first, they wouldn't have started away. He made a plausible\nexcuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret\nwould keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had\nmeant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.\n\nThe lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,\nchattering all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and admiring the\ngenius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to\nlearn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to\ntry, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never\nsmoked anything before but cigars made of grape-vine, and they \"bit\"\nthe tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.\n\nNow they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,\ncharily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant\ntaste, and they gagged a little, but Tom said:\n\n\"Why, it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed this was all, I'd a learnt\nlong ago.\"\n\n\"So would I,\" said Joe. \"It's just nothing.\"\n\n\"Why, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought well I\nwish I could do that; but I never thought I could,\" said Tom.\n\n\"That's just the way with me, hain't it, Huck? You've heard me talk\njust that way--haven't you, Huck? I'll leave it to Huck if I haven't.\"\n\n\"Yes--heaps of times,\" said Huck.\n\n\"Well, I have too,\" said Tom; \"oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the\nslaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and\nJohnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don't you remember,\nHuck, 'bout me saying that?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's so,\" said Huck. \"That was the day after I lost a white\nalley. No, 'twas the day before.\"\n\n\"There--I told you so,\" said Tom. \"Huck recollects it.\"\n\n\"I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,\" said Joe. \"I don't feel\nsick.\"\n\n\"Neither do I,\" said Tom. \"I could smoke it all day. But I bet you\nJeff Thatcher couldn't.\"\n\n\"Jeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just let him\ntry it once. HE'D see!\"\n\n\"I bet he would. And Johnny Miller--I wish could see Johnny Miller\ntackle it once.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't I!\" said Joe. \"Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't any\nmore do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch HIM.\"\n\n\"'Deed it would, Joe. Say--I wish the boys could see us now.\"\n\n\"So do I.\"\n\n\"Say--boys, don't say anything about it, and some time when they're\naround, I'll come up to you and say, 'Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.'\nAnd you'll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn't anything, you'll\nsay, 'Yes, I got my OLD pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain't\nvery good.' And I'll say, 'Oh, that's all right, if it's STRONG\nenough.' And then you'll out with the pipes, and we'll light up just as\nca'm, and then just see 'em look!\"\n\n\"By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was NOW!\"\n\n\"So do I! And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating,\nwon't they wish they'd been along?\"\n\n\"Oh, I reckon not! I'll just BET they will!\"\n\nSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and grow\ndisjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously\nincreased. Every pore inside the boys' cheeks became a spouting\nfountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues\nfast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their\nthroats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings\nfollowed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,\nnow. Joe's pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom's followed.\nBoth fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might\nand main. Joe said feebly:\n\n\"I've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.\"\n\nTom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:\n\n\"I'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the\nspring. No, you needn't come, Huck--we can find it.\"\n\nSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,\nand went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both\nvery pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they\nhad had any trouble they had got rid of it.\n\nThey were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,\nand when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare\ntheirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well--something they\nate at dinner had disagreed with them.\n\nAbout midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding\noppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys\nhuddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of\nthe fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was\nstifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush\ncontinued. Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in\nthe blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that\nvaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by\nanother came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came\nsighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting\nbreath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit\nof the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned\nnight into day and showed every little grass-blade, separate and\ndistinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,\nstartled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling\ndown the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A\nsweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the\nflaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the\nforest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the tree-tops\nright over the boys' heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick\ngloom that followed. A few big rain-drops fell pattering upon the\nleaves.\n\n\"Quick! boys, go for the tent!\" exclaimed Tom.\n\nThey sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no\ntwo plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through the\ntrees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after\nanother came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a\ndrenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets\nalong the ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring\nwind and the booming thunder-blasts drowned their voices utterly.\nHowever, one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under\nthe tent, cold, scared, and streaming with water; but to have company\nin misery seemed something to be grateful for. They could not talk, the\nold sail flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would have\nallowed them. The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the\nsail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast.\nThe boys seized each others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and\nbruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the river-bank.\nNow the battle was at its highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of\nlightning that flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in\nclean-cut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy\nriver, white with foam, the driving spray of spume-flakes, the dim\noutlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the\ndrifting cloud-rack and the slanting veil of rain. Every little while\nsome giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger\ngrowth; and the unflagging thunder-peals came now in ear-splitting\nexplosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably appalling. The storm\nculminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island\nto pieces, burn it up, drown it to the tree-tops, blow it away, and\ndeafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment. It was a\nwild night for homeless young heads to be out in.\n\nBut at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker\nand weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The\nboys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was\nstill something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the\nshelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and\nthey were not under it when the catastrophe happened.\n\nEverything in camp was drenched, the camp-fire as well; for they were\nbut heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision\nagainst rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through\nand chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently\ndiscovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had\nbeen built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from\nthe ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so\nthey patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the\nunder sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then\nthey piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and\nwere glad-hearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a\nfeast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified\ntheir midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to\nsleep on, anywhere around.\n\nAs the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over them,\nand they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got\nscorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After\nthe meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once\nmore. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as\nhe could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming,\nor anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray\nof cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This\nwas to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a\nchange. They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before\nthey were stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like\nso many zebras--all of them chiefs, of course--and then they went\ntearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.\n\nBy and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon\neach other from ambush with dreadful war-whoops, and killed and scalped\neach other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an\nextremely satisfactory one.\n\nThey assembled in camp toward supper-time, hungry and happy; but now a\ndifficulty arose--hostile Indians could not break the bread of\nhospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple\nimpossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other\nprocess that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished\nthey had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with\nsuch show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe\nand took their whiff as it passed, in due form.\n\nAnd behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had\ngained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without\nhaving to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to\nbe seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high\npromise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after\nsupper, with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening.\nThey were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would\nhave been in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will\nleave them to smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use\nfor them at present.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nBUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil\nSaturday afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly's family, were being\nput into mourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet\npossessed the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all\nconscience. The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air,\nand talked little; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a\nburden to the children. They had no heart in their sports, and\ngradually gave them up.\n\nIn the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the\ndeserted schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found\nnothing there to comfort her. She soliloquized:\n\n\"Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got\nanything now to remember him by.\" And she choked back a little sob.\n\nPresently she stopped, and said to herself:\n\n\"It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't say\nthat--I wouldn't say it for the whole world. But he's gone now; I'll\nnever, never, never see him any more.\"\n\nThis thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling\ndown her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls--playmates of\nTom's and Joe's--came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and\ntalking in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they\nsaw him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with\nawful prophecy, as they could easily see now!)--and each speaker\npointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and\nthen added something like \"and I was a-standing just so--just as I am\nnow, and as if you was him--I was as close as that--and he smiled, just\nthis way--and then something seemed to go all over me, like--awful, you\nknow--and I never thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!\"\n\nThen there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and\nmany claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or\nless tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided\nwho DID see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,\nthe lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance, and\nwere gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had no\nother grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the\nremembrance:\n\n\"Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.\"\n\nBut that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,\nand so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered\naway, still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.\n\nWhen the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell\nbegan to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still\nSabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush\nthat lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment\nin the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there\nwas no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses\nas the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None\ncould remember when the little church had been so full before. There\nwas finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly\nentered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all\nin deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well,\nrose reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front\npew. There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by\nmuffled sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed.\nA moving hymn was sung, and the text followed: \"I am the Resurrection\nand the Life.\"\n\nAs the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the\ngraces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that\nevery soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang in\nremembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always\nbefore, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor\nboys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the\ndeparted, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the\npeople could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes\nwere, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had\nseemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The\ncongregation became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on,\ntill at last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping\nmourners in a chorus of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way\nto his feelings, and crying in the pulpit.\n\nThere was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment\nlater the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes\nabove his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then\nanother pair of eyes followed the minister's, and then almost with one\nimpulse the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came\nmarching up the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of\ndrooping rags, sneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in\nthe unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon!\n\nAunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored\nones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while\npoor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what to\ndo or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and\nstarted to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:\n\n\"Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see Huck.\"\n\n\"And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing!\" And\nthe loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing\ncapable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.\n\nSuddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: \"Praise God\nfrom whom all blessings flow--SING!--and put your hearts in it!\"\n\nAnd they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and\nwhile it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the\nenvying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was\nthe proudest moment of his life.\n\nAs the \"sold\" congregation trooped out they said they would almost be\nwilling to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that\nonce more.\n\nTom got more cuffs and kisses that day--according to Aunt Polly's\nvarying moods--than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew\nwhich expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHAT was Tom's great secret--the scheme to return home with his\nbrother pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to\nthe Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six\nmiles below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the\ntown till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and\nalleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a\nchaos of invalided benches.\n\nAt breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to\nTom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of\ntalk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:\n\n\"Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody\nsuffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity\nyou could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come\nover on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give\nme a hint some way that you warn't dead, but only run off.\"\n\n\"Yes, you could have done that, Tom,\" said Mary; \"and I believe you\nwould if you had thought of it.\"\n\n\"Would you, Tom?\" said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. \"Say,\nnow, would you, if you'd thought of it?\"\n\n\"I--well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything.\"\n\n\"Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,\" said Aunt Polly, with a grieved\ntone that discomforted the boy. \"It would have been something if you'd\ncared enough to THINK of it, even if you didn't DO it.\"\n\n\"Now, auntie, that ain't any harm,\" pleaded Mary; \"it's only Tom's\ngiddy way--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of\nanything.\"\n\n\"More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and\nDONE it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's too late, and\nwish you'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so\nlittle.\"\n\n\"Now, auntie, you know I do care for you,\" said Tom.\n\n\"I'd know it better if you acted more like it.\"\n\n\"I wish now I'd thought,\" said Tom, with a repentant tone; \"but I\ndreamt about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?\"\n\n\"It ain't much--a cat does that much--but it's better than nothing.\nWhat did you dream?\"\n\n\"Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the\nbed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.\"\n\n\"Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could take\neven that much trouble about us.\"\n\n\"And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here.\"\n\n\"Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?\"\n\n\"Oh, lots. But it's so dim, now.\"\n\n\"Well, try to recollect--can't you?\"\n\n\"Somehow it seems to me that the wind--the wind blowed the--the--\"\n\n\"Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!\"\n\nTom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then\nsaid:\n\n\"I've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!\"\n\n\"Mercy on us! Go on, Tom--go on!\"\n\n\"And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door--'\"\n\n\"Go ON, Tom!\"\n\n\"Just let me study a moment--just a moment. Oh, yes--you said you\nbelieved the door was open.\"\n\n\"As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!\"\n\n\"And then--and then--well I won't be certain, but it seems like as if\nyou made Sid go and--and--\"\n\n\"Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?\"\n\n\"You made him--you--Oh, you made him shut it.\"\n\n\"Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my\ndays! Don't tell ME there ain't anything in dreams, any more. Sereny\nHarper shall know of this before I'm an hour older. I'd like to see her\nget around THIS with her rubbage 'bout superstition. Go on, Tom!\"\n\n\"Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I\nwarn't BAD, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more\nresponsible than--than--I think it was a colt, or something.\"\n\n\"And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!\"\n\n\"And then you began to cry.\"\n\n\"So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then--\"\n\n\"Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same,\nand she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when she'd\nthrowed it out her own self--\"\n\n\"Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying--that's what you\nwas doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!\"\n\n\"Then Sid he said--he said--\"\n\n\"I don't think I said anything,\" said Sid.\n\n\"Yes you did, Sid,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?\"\n\n\"He said--I THINK he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone\nto, but if I'd been better sometimes--\"\n\n\"THERE, d'you hear that! It was his very words!\"\n\n\"And you shut him up sharp.\"\n\n\"I lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There WAS an angel\nthere, somewheres!\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and\nyou told about Peter and the Painkiller--\"\n\n\"Just as true as I live!\"\n\n\"And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for\nus, and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss\nHarper hugged and cried, and she went.\"\n\n\"It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm a-sitting in\nthese very tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more like if you'd 'a'\nseen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!\"\n\n\"Then I thought you prayed for me--and I could see you and hear every\nword you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and\nwrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off\nbeing pirates,' and put it on the table by the candle; and then you\nlooked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned\nover and kissed you on the lips.\"\n\n\"Did you, Tom, DID you! I just forgive you everything for that!\" And\nshe seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the\nguiltiest of villains.\n\n\"It was very kind, even though it was only a--dream,\" Sid soliloquized\njust audibly.\n\n\"Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he\nwas awake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you, Tom, if\nyou was ever found again--now go 'long to school. I'm thankful to the\ngood God and Father of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering\nand merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though\ngoodness knows I'm unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His\nblessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there's\nfew enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long\nnight comes. Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you've\nhendered me long enough.\"\n\nThe children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper\nand vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid had better\njudgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the\nhouse. It was this: \"Pretty thin--as long a dream as that, without any\nmistakes in it!\"\n\nWhat a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,\nbut moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the\npublic eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see\nthe looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food\nand drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as\nproud to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the\ndrummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie\ninto town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away\nat all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would\nhave given anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his, and his\nglittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a\ncircus.\n\nAt school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered\nsuch eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were not\nlong in becoming insufferably \"stuck-up.\" They began to tell their\nadventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a thing\nlikely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish\nmaterial. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely\npuffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.\n\nTom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory\nwas sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,\nmaybe she would be wanting to \"make up.\" Well, let her--she should see\nthat he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she\narrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group\nof boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was\ntripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,\npretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter\nwhen she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her\ncaptures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye\nin his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious\nvanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only \"set\nhim up\" the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that\nhe knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved\nirresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and\nwistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more\nparticularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp\npang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but\nher feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She\nsaid to a girl almost at Tom's elbow--with sham vivacity:\n\n\"Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to Sunday-school?\"\n\n\"I did come--didn't you see me?\"\n\n\"Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?\"\n\n\"I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw YOU.\"\n\n\"Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about\nthe picnic.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?\"\n\n\"My ma's going to let me have one.\"\n\n\"Oh, goody; I hope she'll let ME come.\"\n\n\"Well, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come that I\nwant, and I want you.\"\n\n\"That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?\"\n\n\"By and by. Maybe about vacation.\"\n\n\"Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?\"\n\n\"Yes, every one that's friends to me--or wants to be\"; and she glanced\never so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence\nabout the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the\ngreat sycamore tree \"all to flinders\" while he was \"standing within\nthree feet of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, may I come?\" said Grace Miller.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And me?\" said Sally Rogers.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And me, too?\" said Susy Harper. \"And Joe?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAnd so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged\nfor invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still\ntalking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled and the tears\ncame to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on\nchattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of\neverything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and\nhad what her sex call \"a good cry.\" Then she sat moody, with wounded\npride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast\nin her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what\nSHE'D do.\n\nAt recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant\nself-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate\nher with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden\nfalling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind\nthe schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple--and so\nabsorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,\nthat they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.\nJealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins. He began to hate himself for\nthrowing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He\ncalled himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He\nwanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,\nfor her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function. He\ndid not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he\ncould only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as\notherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and\nagain, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could\nnot help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that\nBecky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the\nliving. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her\nfight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.\n\nAmy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to\nattend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in\nvain--the girl chirped on. Tom thought, \"Oh, hang her, ain't I ever\ngoing to get rid of her?\" At last he must be attending to those\nthings--and she said artlessly that she would be \"around\" when school\nlet out. And he hastened away, hating her for it.\n\n\"Any other boy!\" Tom thought, grating his teeth. \"Any boy in the whole\ntown but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is\naristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw\nthis town, mister, and I'll lick you again! You just wait till I catch\nyou out! I'll just take and--\"\n\nAnd he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy\n--pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. \"Oh, you do, do you? You\nholler 'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!\" And so the\nimaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.\n\nTom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of\nAmy's grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the\nother distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but\nas the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph\nbegan to cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absent-mindedness\nfollowed, and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her\near at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she\ngrew entirely miserable and wished she hadn't carried it so far. When\npoor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept\nexclaiming: \"Oh, here's a jolly one! look at this!\" she lost patience\nat last, and said, \"Oh, don't bother me! I don't care for them!\" and\nburst into tears, and got up and walked away.\n\nAlfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she\nsaid:\n\n\"Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!\"\n\nSo the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said\nshe would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on,\ncrying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was\nhumiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl\nhad simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.\nHe was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.\nHe wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much\nrisk to himself. Tom's spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his\nopportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and\npoured ink upon the page.\n\nBecky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,\nand moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,\nintending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their\ntroubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she\nhad changed her mind. The thought of Tom's treatment of her when she\nwas talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with\nshame. She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged\nspelling-book's account, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt\nsaid to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an\nunpromising market:\n\n\"Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!\"\n\n\"Auntie, what have I done?\"\n\n\"Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an\nold softy, expecting I'm going to make her believe all that rubbage\nabout that dream, when lo and behold you she'd found out from Joe that\nyou was over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I\ndon't know what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes\nme feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make\nsuch a fool of myself and never say a word.\"\n\nThis was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had\nseemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked\nmean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything\nto say for a moment. Then he said:\n\n\"Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it--but I didn't think.\"\n\n\"Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own\nselfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from\nJackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could\nthink to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn't ever think\nto pity us and save us from sorrow.\"\n\n\"Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I\ndidn't, honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you\nthat night.\"\n\n\"What did you come for, then?\"\n\n\"It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got\ndrownded.\"\n\n\"Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could\nbelieve you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never\ndid--and I know it, Tom.\"\n\n\"Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie--I wish I may never stir if I didn't.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom, don't lie--don't do it. It only makes things a hundred times\nworse.\"\n\n\"It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you from\ngrieving--that was all that made me come.\"\n\n\"I'd give the whole world to believe that--it would cover up a power\nof sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. But it\nain't reasonable; because, why didn't you tell me, child?\"\n\n\"Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got\nall full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I\ncouldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my\npocket and kept mum.\"\n\n\"What bark?\"\n\n\"The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish, now,\nyou'd waked up when I kissed you--I do, honest.\"\n\nThe hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness\ndawned in her eyes.\n\n\"DID you kiss me, Tom?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I did.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you did, Tom?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I did, auntie--certain sure.\"\n\n\"What did you kiss me for, Tom?\"\n\n\"Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.\"\n\nThe words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in\nher voice when she said:\n\n\"Kiss me again, Tom!--and be off with you to school, now, and don't\nbother me any more.\"\n\nThe moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a\njacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her\nhand, and said to herself:\n\n\"No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it--but it's a\nblessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort come from it. I hope the\nLord--I KNOW the Lord will forgive him, because it was such\ngoodheartedness in him to tell it. But I don't want to find out it's a\nlie. I won't look.\"\n\nShe put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put\nout her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once\nmore she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the\nthought: \"It's a good lie--it's a good lie--I won't let it grieve me.\"\nSo she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom's\npiece of bark through flowing tears and saying: \"I could forgive the\nboy, now, if he'd committed a million sins!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHERE was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed Tom,\nthat swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy\nagain. He started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky\nThatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his\nmanner. Without a moment's hesitation he ran to her and said:\n\n\"I acted mighty mean to-day, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever,\never do that way again, as long as ever I live--please make up, won't\nyou?\"\n\nThe girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:\n\n\"I'll thank you to keep yourself TO yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I'll\nnever speak to you again.\"\n\nShe tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not\neven presence of mind enough to say \"Who cares, Miss Smarty?\" until the\nright time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a\nfine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were\na boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently\nencountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She\nhurled one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to\nBecky, in her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to\n\"take in,\" she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured\nspelling-book. If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred\nTemple, Tom's offensive fling had driven it entirely away.\n\nPoor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.\nThe master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied\nambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty\nhad decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village\nschoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and\nabsorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept\nthat book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was\nperishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy\nand girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two\ntheories were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in\nthe case. Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the\ndoor, she noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious\nmoment. She glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant\nshe had the book in her hands. The title-page--Professor Somebody's\nANATOMY--carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn the\nleaves. She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored\nfrontispiece--a human figure, stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell\non the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse\nof the picture. Becky snatched at the book to close it, and had the\nhard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle. She thrust\nthe volume into the desk, turned the key, and burst out crying with\nshame and vexation.\n\n\"Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a\nperson and look at what they're looking at.\"\n\n\"How could I know you was looking at anything?\"\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're\ngoing to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be\nwhipped, and I never was whipped in school.\"\n\nThen she stamped her little foot and said:\n\n\"BE so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to happen.\nYou just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!\"--and she\nflung out of the house with a new explosion of crying.\n\nTom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said\nto himself:\n\n\"What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in school!\nShucks! What's a licking! That's just like a girl--they're so\nthin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain't going to tell\nold Dobbins on this little fool, because there's other ways of getting\neven on her, that ain't so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask\nwho it was tore his book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do just the way\nhe always does--ask first one and then t'other, and when he comes to the\nright girl he'll know it, without any telling. Girls' faces always tell\non them. They ain't got any backbone. She'll get licked. Well, it's a\nkind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain't any way\nout of it.\" Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: \"All\nright, though; she'd like to see me in just such a fix--let her sweat it\nout!\"\n\nTom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments\nthe master arrived and school \"took in.\" Tom did not feel a strong\ninterest in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls'\nside of the room Becky's face troubled him. Considering all things, he\ndid not want to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He\ncould get up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently\nthe spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom's mind was entirely full\nof his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her\nlethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She\ndid not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he\nspilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only\nseemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be\nglad of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she\nfound she was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an\nimpulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and\nforced herself to keep still--because, said she to herself, \"he'll tell\nabout me tearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not to save\nhis life!\"\n\nTom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all\nbroken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly\nupset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout--he\nhad denied it for form's sake and because it was custom, and had stuck\nto the denial from principle.\n\nA whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air\nwas drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened\nhimself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,\nbut seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the\npupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched\nhis movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently\nfor a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!\nTom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit\nlook as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot\nhis quarrel with her. Quick--something must be done! done in a flash,\ntoo! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.\nGood!--he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring\nthrough the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little\ninstant, and the chance was lost--the master opened the volume. If Tom\nonly had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help\nfor Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.\nEvery eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even\nthe innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten\n--the master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: \"Who tore this book?\"\n\nThere was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness\ncontinued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.\n\n\"Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?\"\n\nA denial. Another pause.\n\n\"Joseph Harper, did you?\"\n\nAnother denial. Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the\nslow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of\nboys--considered a while, then turned to the girls:\n\n\"Amy Lawrence?\"\n\nA shake of the head.\n\n\"Gracie Miller?\"\n\nThe same sign.\n\n\"Susan Harper, did you do this?\"\n\nAnother negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling\nfrom head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of\nthe situation.\n\n\"Rebecca Thatcher\" [Tom glanced at her face--it was white with terror]\n--\"did you tear--no, look me in the face\" [her hands rose in appeal]\n--\"did you tear this book?\"\n\nA thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang to his\nfeet and shouted--\"I done it!\"\n\nThe school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a\nmoment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped\nforward to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the\nadoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky's eyes seemed pay\nenough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own\nact, he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr.\nDobbins had ever administered; and also received with indifference the\nadded cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be\ndismissed--for he knew who would wait for him outside till his\ncaptivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss, either.\n\nTom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple;\nfor with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting\nher own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way,\nsoon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky's\nlatest words lingering dreamily in his ear--\n\n\"Tom, how COULD you be so noble!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nVACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew\nseverer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a\ngood showing on \"Examination\" day. His rod and his ferule were seldom\nidle now--at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and\nyoung ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins'\nlashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under\nhis wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle\nage, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great\nday approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he\nseemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least\nshortcomings. The consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their\ndays in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge. They\nthrew away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he kept\nahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful\nsuccess was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from\nthe field badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a\nplan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the sign-painter's\nboy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons\nfor being delighted, for the master boarded in his father's family and\nhad given the boy ample cause to hate him. The master's wife would go\non a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to\ninterfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great\noccasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the sign-painter's boy\nsaid that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on\nExamination Evening he would \"manage the thing\" while he napped in his\nchair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried\naway to school.\n\nIn the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in\nthe evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with\nwreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in\nhis great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.\nHe was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and\nsix rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town\nand by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of\ncitizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the\nscholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of\nsmall boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;\nrows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in\nlawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their\ngrandmothers' ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and\nthe flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with\nnon-participating scholars.\n\nThe exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly\nrecited, \"You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the\nstage,\" etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and\nspasmodic gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the\nmachine to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though\ncruelly scared, and got a fine round of applause when he made his\nmanufactured bow and retired.\n\nA little shamefaced girl lisped, \"Mary had a little lamb,\" etc.,\nperformed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and\nsat down flushed and happy.\n\nTom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into\nthe unquenchable and indestructible \"Give me liberty or give me death\"\nspeech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the\nmiddle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under\nhim and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the\nhouse but he had the house's silence, too, which was even worse than\nits sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom\nstruggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak\nattempt at applause, but it died early.\n\n\"The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck\" followed; also \"The Assyrian Came\nDown,\" and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,\nand a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The\nprime feature of the evening was in order, now--original \"compositions\"\nby the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of\nthe platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with\ndainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to\n\"expression\" and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been\nilluminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their\ngrandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line\nclear back to the Crusades. \"Friendship\" was one; \"Memories of Other\nDays\"; \"Religion in History\"; \"Dream Land\"; \"The Advantages of\nCulture\"; \"Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted\";\n\"Melancholy\"; \"Filial Love\"; \"Heart Longings,\" etc., etc.\n\nA prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted\nmelancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of \"fine language\";\nanother was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words\nand phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that\nconspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable\nsermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one\nof them. No matter what the subject might be, a brain-racking effort\nwas made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and\nreligious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring\ninsincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the\nbanishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient\nto-day; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps.\nThere is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel\nobliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find\nthat the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in\nthe school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But\nenough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.\n\nLet us return to the \"Examination.\" The first composition that was\nread was one entitled \"Is this, then, Life?\" Perhaps the reader can\nendure an extract from it:\n\n  \"In the common walks of life, with what delightful\n   emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some\n   anticipated scene of festivity! Imagination is busy\n   sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the\n   voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the\n   festive throng, 'the observed of all observers.' Her\n   graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling\n   through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is\n   brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly.\n\n  \"In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by,\n   and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into\n   the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright\n   dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to\n   her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming\n   than the last. But after a while she finds that\n   beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the\n   flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates\n   harshly upon her ear; the ball-room has lost its\n   charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart,\n   she turns away with the conviction that earthly\n   pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!\"\n\nAnd so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to\ntime during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of \"How\nsweet!\" \"How eloquent!\" \"So true!\" etc., and after the thing had closed\nwith a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.\n\nThen arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the \"interesting\"\npaleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a \"poem.\" Two\nstanzas of it will do:\n\n   \"A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA\n\n   \"Alabama, good-bye! I love thee well!\n      But yet for a while do I leave thee now!\n    Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,\n      And burning recollections throng my brow!\n    For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;\n      Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream;\n    Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods,\n      And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam.\n\n   \"Yet shame I not to bear an o'er-full heart,\n      Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;\n    'Tis from no stranger land I now must part,\n      'Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.\n    Welcome and home were mine within this State,\n      Whose vales I leave--whose spires fade fast from me\n    And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete,\n      When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!\"\n\nThere were very few there who knew what \"tete\" meant, but the poem was\nvery satisfactory, nevertheless.\n\nNext appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young\nlady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and\nbegan to read in a measured, solemn tone:\n\n  \"A VISION\n\n   \"Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the\n   throne on high not a single star quivered; but\n   the deep intonations of the heavy thunder\n   constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the\n   terrific lightning revelled in angry mood\n   through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming\n   to scorn the power exerted over its terror by\n   the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous\n   winds unanimously came forth from their mystic\n   homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by\n   their aid the wildness of the scene.\n\n   \"At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human\n   sympathy my very spirit sighed; but instead thereof,\n\n   \"'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter\n   and guide--My joy in grief, my second bliss\n   in joy,' came to my side. She moved like one of\n   those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks\n   of fancy's Eden by the romantic and young, a\n   queen of beauty unadorned save by her own\n   transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it\n   failed to make even a sound, and but for the\n   magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as\n   other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided\n   away un-perceived--unsought. A strange sadness\n   rested upon her features, like icy tears upon\n   the robe of December, as she pointed to the\n   contending elements without, and bade me contemplate\n   the two beings presented.\"\n\nThis nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with\na sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took\nthe first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest\neffort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the\nprize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it\nwas by far the most \"eloquent\" thing he had ever listened to, and that\nDaniel Webster himself might well be proud of it.\n\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in\nwhich the word \"beauteous\" was over-fondled, and human experience\nreferred to as \"life's page,\" was up to the usual average.\n\nNow the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair\naside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of\nAmerica on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he\nmade a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered\ntitter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set\nhimself to right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only\ndistorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced.\nHe threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not\nto be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon\nhim; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it\neven manifestly increased. And well it might. There was a garret above,\npierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle\ncame a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag\ntied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly\ndescended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung\ndownward and clawed at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher\nand higher--the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher's\nhead--down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her\ndesperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an\ninstant with her trophy still in her possession! And how the light did\nblaze abroad from the master's bald pate--for the sign-painter's boy\nhad GILDED it!\n\nThat broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.\n\n   NOTE:--The pretended \"compositions\" quoted in\n   this chapter are taken without alteration from a\n   volume entitled \"Prose and Poetry, by a Western\n   Lady\"--but they are exactly and precisely after\n   the schoolgirl pattern, and hence are much\n   happier than any mere imitations could be.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by\nthe showy character of their \"regalia.\" He promised to abstain from\nsmoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he\nfound out a new thing--namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the\nsurest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very\nthing. Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and\nswear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a\nchance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing\nfrom the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up\n--gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours--and\nfixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was\napparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since\nhe was so high an official. During three days Tom was deeply concerned\nabout the Judge's condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his\nhopes ran high--so high that he would venture to get out his regalia\nand practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most\ndiscouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the\nmend--and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense of\ninjury, too. He handed in his resignation at once--and that night the\nJudge suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would never\ntrust a man like that again.\n\nThe funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated\nto kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however\n--there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now--but found\nto his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could,\ntook the desire away, and the charm of it.\n\nTom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning\nto hang a little heavily on his hands.\n\nHe attempted a diary--but nothing happened during three days, and so\nhe abandoned it.\n\nThe first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a\nsensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were\nhappy for two days.\n\nEven the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained\nhard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in\nthe world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States\nSenator, proved an overwhelming disappointment--for he was not\ntwenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.\n\nA circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in\ntents made of rag carpeting--admission, three pins for boys, two for\ngirls--and then circusing was abandoned.\n\nA phrenologist and a mesmerizer came--and went again and left the\nvillage duller and drearier than ever.\n\nThere were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few and so\ndelightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.\n\nBecky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her\nparents during vacation--so there was no bright side to life anywhere.\n\nThe dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very\ncancer for permanency and pain.\n\nThen came the measles.\n\nDuring two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its\nhappenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got\nupon his feet at last and moved feebly down-town, a melancholy change\nhad come over everything and every creature. There had been a\n\"revival,\" and everybody had \"got religion,\" not only the adults, but\neven the boys and girls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the\nsight of one blessed sinful face, but disappointment crossed him\neverywhere. He found Joe Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly\naway from the depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him\nvisiting the poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who\ncalled his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a\nwarning. Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression;\nand when, in desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of\nHuckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his\nheart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all\nthe town was lost, forever and forever.\n\nAnd that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain,\nawful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his\nhead with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his\ndoom; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was\nabout him. He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above\nto the extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might\nhave seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a\nbattery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the\ngetting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf\nfrom under an insect like himself.\n\nBy and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its\nobject. The boy's first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His\nsecond was to wait--for there might not be any more storms.\n\nThe next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks\nhe spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad\nat last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how\nlonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted\nlistlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a\njuvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her\nvictim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a\nstolen melon. Poor lads! they--like Tom--had suffered a relapse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nAT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred--and vigorously: the murder\ntrial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village\ntalk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to\nthe murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience and\nfears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his\nhearing as \"feelers\"; he did not see how he could be suspected of\nknowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be\ncomfortable in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver\nall the time. He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him.\nIt would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to\ndivide his burden of distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he\nwanted to assure himself that Huck had remained discreet.\n\n\"Huck, have you ever told anybody about--that?\"\n\n\"'Bout what?\"\n\n\"You know what.\"\n\n\"Oh--'course I haven't.\"\n\n\"Never a word?\"\n\n\"Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?\"\n\n\"Well, I was afeard.\"\n\n\"Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got found out.\nYOU know that.\"\n\nTom felt more comfortable. After a pause:\n\n\"Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?\"\n\n\"Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that half-breed devil to drownd me\nthey could get me to tell. They ain't no different way.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we keep\nmum. But let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer.\"\n\n\"I'm agreed.\"\n\nSo they swore again with dread solemnities.\n\n\"What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it.\"\n\n\"Talk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the\ntime. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to hide som'ers.\"\n\n\"That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a goner.\nDon't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?\"\n\n\"Most always--most always. He ain't no account; but then he hain't\never done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money\nto get drunk on--and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do\nthat--leastways most of us--preachers and such like. But he's kind of\ngood--he give me half a fish, once, when there warn't enough for two;\nand lots of times he's kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.\"\n\n\"Well, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my\nline. I wish we could get him out of there.\"\n\n\"My! we couldn't get him out, Tom. And besides, 'twouldn't do any\ngood; they'd ketch him again.\"\n\n\"Yes--so they would. But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the\ndickens when he never done--that.\"\n\n\"I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking\nvillain in this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before.\"\n\n\"Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say that if he\nwas to get free they'd lynch him.\"\n\n\"And they'd do it, too.\"\n\nThe boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the\ntwilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood\nof the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that\nsomething would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But\nnothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in\nthis luckless captive.\n\nThe boys did as they had often done before--went to the cell grating\nand gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor\nand there were no guards.\n\nHis gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences\nbefore--it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and\ntreacherous to the last degree when Potter said:\n\n\"You've been mighty good to me, boys--better'n anybody else in this\ntown. And I don't forget it, I don't. Often I says to myself, says I,\n'I used to mend all the boys' kites and things, and show 'em where the\ngood fishin' places was, and befriend 'em what I could, and now they've\nall forgot old Muff when he's in trouble; but Tom don't, and Huck\ndon't--THEY don't forget him, says I, 'and I don't forget them.' Well,\nboys, I done an awful thing--drunk and crazy at the time--that's the\nonly way I account for it--and now I got to swing for it, and it's\nright. Right, and BEST, too, I reckon--hope so, anyway. Well, we won't\ntalk about that. I don't want to make YOU feel bad; you've befriended\nme. But what I want to say, is, don't YOU ever get drunk--then you won't\never get here. Stand a litter furder west--so--that's it; it's a prime\ncomfort to see faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck of\ntrouble, and there don't none come here but yourn. Good friendly\nfaces--good friendly faces. Git up on one another's backs and let me\ntouch 'em. That's it. Shake hands--yourn'll come through the bars, but\nmine's too big. Little hands, and weak--but they've helped Muff Potter\na power, and they'd help him more if they could.\"\n\nTom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of\nhorrors. The next day and the day after, he hung about the court-room,\ndrawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself\nto stay out. Huck was having the same experience. They studiously\navoided each other. Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same\ndismal fascination always brought them back presently. Tom kept his\nears open when idlers sauntered out of the court-room, but invariably\nheard distressing news--the toils were closing more and more\nrelentlessly around poor Potter. At the end of the second day the\nvillage talk was to the effect that Injun Joe's evidence stood firm and\nunshaken, and that there was not the slightest question as to what the\njury's verdict would be.\n\nTom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He\nwas in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to\nsleep. All the village flocked to the court-house the next morning, for\nthis was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented\nin the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took\ntheir places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and\nhopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all\nthe curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,\nstolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and\nthe sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings\namong the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These\ndetails and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation\nthat was as impressive as it was fascinating.\n\nNow a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter\nwashing in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder\nwas discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some\nfurther questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:\n\n\"Take the witness.\"\n\nThe prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when\nhis own counsel said:\n\n\"I have no questions to ask him.\"\n\nThe next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.\nCounsel for the prosecution said:\n\n\"Take the witness.\"\n\n\"I have no questions to ask him,\" Potter's lawyer replied.\n\nA third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's\npossession.\n\n\"Take the witness.\"\n\nCounsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience\nbegan to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his\nclient's life without an effort?\n\nSeveral witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior when\nbrought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the\nstand without being cross-questioned.\n\nEvery detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the\ngraveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was\nbrought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined\nby Potter's lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house\nexpressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.\nCounsel for the prosecution now said:\n\n\"By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we\nhave fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question,\nupon the unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.\"\n\nA groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and\nrocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned in\nthe court-room. Many men were moved, and many women's compassion\ntestified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:\n\n\"Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we\nforeshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed\nwhile under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium\nproduced by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that\nplea.\" [Then to the clerk:] \"Call Thomas Sawyer!\"\n\nA puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even\nexcepting Potter's. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest\nupon Tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked\nwild enough, for he was badly scared. The oath was administered.\n\n\"Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the\nhour of midnight?\"\n\nTom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed him. The\naudience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a\nfew moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and\nmanaged to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house\nhear:\n\n\"In the graveyard!\"\n\n\"A little bit louder, please. Don't be afraid. You were--\"\n\n\"In the graveyard.\"\n\nA contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe's face.\n\n\"Were you anywhere near Horse Williams' grave?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Speak up--just a trifle louder. How near were you?\"\n\n\"Near as I am to you.\"\n\n\"Were you hidden, or not?\"\n\n\"I was hid.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave.\"\n\nInjun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.\n\n\"Any one with you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I went there with--\"\n\n\"Wait--wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion's name. We\nwill produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with\nyou.\"\n\nTom hesitated and looked confused.\n\n\"Speak out, my boy--don't be diffident. The truth is always\nrespectable. What did you take there?\"\n\n\"Only a--a--dead cat.\"\n\nThere was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.\n\n\"We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us\neverything that occurred--tell it in your own way--don't skip anything,\nand don't be afraid.\"\n\nTom began--hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his\nwords flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased\nbut his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips\nand bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of\ntime, rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon\npent emotion reached its climax when the boy said:\n\n\"--and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell,\nInjun Joe jumped with the knife and--\"\n\nCrash! Quick as lightning the half-breed sprang for a window, tore his\nway through all opposers, and was gone!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTOM was a glittering hero once more--the pet of the old, the envy of\nthe young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village\npaper magnified him. There were some that believed he would be\nPresident, yet, if he escaped hanging.\n\nAs usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom\nand fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort\nof conduct is to the world's credit; therefore it is not well to find\nfault with it.\n\nTom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights\nwere seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always\nwith doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to\nstir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of\nwretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer\nthe night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid\nthat his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding\nInjun Joe's flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.\nThe poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of\nthat? Since Tom's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the\nlawyer's house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been\nsealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck's\nconfidence in the human race was well-nigh obliterated.\n\nDaily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly\nhe wished he had sealed up his tongue.\n\nHalf the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the\nother half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw\na safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.\n\nRewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun\nJoe was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a\ndetective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head,\nlooked wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of\nthat craft usually achieve. That is to say, he \"found a clew.\" But you\ncan't hang a \"clew\" for murder, and so after that detective had got\nthrough and gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.\n\nThe slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened\nweight of apprehension.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life when he has\na raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This\ndesire suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe\nHarper, but failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone\nfishing. Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck\nwould answer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to\nhim confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a\nhand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no\ncapital, for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time\nwhich is not money. \"Where'll we dig?\" said Huck.\n\n\"Oh, most anywhere.\"\n\n\"Why, is it hid all around?\"\n\n\"No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places, Huck\n--sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a\nlimb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but\nmostly under the floor in ha'nted houses.\"\n\n\"Who hides it?\"\n\n\"Why, robbers, of course--who'd you reckon? Sunday-school\nsup'rintendents?\"\n\n\"I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't hide it; I'd spend it and have\na good time.\"\n\n\"So would I. But robbers don't do that way. They always hide it and\nleave it there.\"\n\n\"Don't they come after it any more?\"\n\n\"No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or\nelse they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by\nand by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the\nmarks--a paper that's got to be ciphered over about a week because it's\nmostly signs and hy'roglyphics.\"\n\n\"HyroQwhich?\"\n\n\"Hy'roglyphics--pictures and things, you know, that don't seem to mean\nanything.\"\n\n\"Have you got one of them papers, Tom?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well then, how you going to find the marks?\"\n\n\"I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted house or\non an island, or under a dead tree that's got one limb sticking out.\nWell, we've tried Jackson's Island a little, and we can try it again\nsome time; and there's the old ha'nted house up the Still-House branch,\nand there's lots of dead-limb trees--dead loads of 'em.\"\n\n\"Is it under all of them?\"\n\n\"How you talk! No!\"\n\n\"Then how you going to know which one to go for?\"\n\n\"Go for all of 'em!\"\n\n\"Why, Tom, it'll take all summer.\"\n\n\"Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred\ndollars in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di'monds.\nHow's that?\"\n\nHuck's eyes glowed.\n\n\"That's bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred\ndollars and I don't want no di'monds.\"\n\n\"All right. But I bet you I ain't going to throw off on di'monds. Some\nof 'em's worth twenty dollars apiece--there ain't any, hardly, but's\nworth six bits or a dollar.\"\n\n\"No! Is that so?\"\n\n\"Cert'nly--anybody'll tell you so. Hain't you ever seen one, Huck?\"\n\n\"Not as I remember.\"\n\n\"Oh, kings have slathers of them.\"\n\n\"Well, I don' know no kings, Tom.\"\n\n\"I reckon you don't. But if you was to go to Europe you'd see a raft\nof 'em hopping around.\"\n\n\"Do they hop?\"\n\n\"Hop?--your granny! No!\"\n\n\"Well, what did you say they did, for?\"\n\n\"Shucks, I only meant you'd SEE 'em--not hopping, of course--what do\nthey want to hop for?--but I mean you'd just see 'em--scattered around,\nyou know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.\"\n\n\"Richard? What's his other name?\"\n\n\"He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a given name.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"But they don't.\"\n\n\"Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don't want to be a king\nand have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say--where you\ngoing to dig first?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know. S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the\nhill t'other side of Still-House branch?\"\n\n\"I'm agreed.\"\n\nSo they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their\nthree-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves\ndown in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.\n\n\"I like this,\" said Tom.\n\n\"So do I.\"\n\n\"Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your\nshare?\"\n\n\"Well, I'll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I'll go to\nevery circus that comes along. I bet I'll have a gay time.\"\n\n\"Well, ain't you going to save any of it?\"\n\n\"Save it? What for?\"\n\n\"Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.\"\n\n\"Oh, that ain't any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some\nday and get his claws on it if I didn't hurry up, and I tell you he'd\nclean it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?\"\n\n\"I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure-'nough sword, and a red\nnecktie and a bull pup, and get married.\"\n\n\"Married!\"\n\n\"That's it.\"\n\n\"Tom, you--why, you ain't in your right mind.\"\n\n\"Wait--you'll see.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my\nmother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty\nwell.\"\n\n\"That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't fight.\"\n\n\"Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now you\nbetter think 'bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What's the name\nof the gal?\"\n\n\"It ain't a gal at all--it's a girl.\"\n\n\"It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl--both's\nright, like enough. Anyway, what's her name, Tom?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you some time--not now.\"\n\n\"All right--that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be more lonesomer\nthan ever.\"\n\n\"No you won't. You'll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and\nwe'll go to digging.\"\n\nThey worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled\nanother half-hour. Still no result. Huck said:\n\n\"Do they always bury it as deep as this?\"\n\n\"Sometimes--not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven't got the\nright place.\"\n\nSo they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little,\nbut still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some\ntime. Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from\nhis brow with his sleeve, and said:\n\n\"Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?\"\n\n\"I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on\nCardiff Hill back of the widow's.\"\n\n\"I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it away from\nus, Tom? It's on her land.\"\n\n\"SHE take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever finds one\nof these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don't make any difference\nwhose land it's on.\"\n\nThat was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:\n\n\"Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?\"\n\n\"It is mighty curious, Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes witches\ninterfere. I reckon maybe that's what's the trouble now.\"\n\n\"Shucks! Witches ain't got no power in the daytime.\"\n\n\"Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, I know what the matter\nis! What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the\nshadow of the limb falls at midnight, and that's where you dig!\"\n\n\"Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for nothing. Now\nhang it all, we got to come back in the night. It's an awful long way.\nCan you get out?\"\n\n\"I bet I will. We've got to do it to-night, too, because if somebody\nsees these holes they'll know in a minute what's here and they'll go\nfor it.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll come around and maow to-night.\"\n\n\"All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes.\"\n\nThe boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in\nthe shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by\nold traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked\nin the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the\ndistance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were\nsubdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged\nthat twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to\ndig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and\ntheir industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,\nbut every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon\nsomething, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone\nor a chunk. At last Tom said:\n\n\"It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again.\"\n\n\"Well, but we CAN'T be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.\"\n\n\"I know it, but then there's another thing.\"\n\n\"What's that?\".\n\n\"Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too\nearly.\"\n\nHuck dropped his shovel.\n\n\"That's it,\" said he. \"That's the very trouble. We got to give this\none up. We can't ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of\nthing's too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts\na-fluttering around so. I feel as if something's behind me all the time;\nand I'm afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there's others in front\na-waiting for a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.\"\n\n\"Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a\ndead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.\"\n\n\"Lordy!\"\n\n\"Yes, they do. I've always heard that.\"\n\n\"Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead people. A\nbody's bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure.\"\n\n\"I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was to\nstick his skull out and say something!\"\n\n\"Don't Tom! It's awful.\"\n\n\"Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit.\"\n\n\"Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres else.\"\n\n\"All right, I reckon we better.\"\n\n\"What'll it be?\"\n\nTom considered awhile; and then said:\n\n\"The ha'nted house. That's it!\"\n\n\"Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern sight\nworse'n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don't come\nsliding around in a shroud, when you ain't noticing, and peep over your\nshoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I\ncouldn't stand such a thing as that, Tom--nobody could.\"\n\n\"Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They won't\nhender us from digging there in the daytime.\"\n\n\"Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about that\nha'nted house in the day nor the night.\"\n\n\"Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's been\nmurdered, anyway--but nothing's ever been seen around that house except\nin the night--just some blue lights slipping by the windows--no regular\nghosts.\"\n\n\"Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom,\nyou can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to\nreason. Becuz you know that they don't anybody but ghosts use 'em.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the daytime, so\nwhat's the use of our being afeard?\"\n\n\"Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so--but I\nreckon it's taking chances.\"\n\nThey had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of\nthe moonlit valley below them stood the \"ha'nted\" house, utterly\nisolated, its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very\ndoorsteps, the chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a\ncorner of the roof caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to\nsee a blue light flit past a window; then talking in a low tone, as\nbefitted the time and the circumstances, they struck far off to the\nright, to give the haunted house a wide berth, and took their way\nhomeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff\nHill.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had\ncome for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house;\nHuck was measurably so, also--but suddenly said:\n\n\"Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?\"\n\nTom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted\nhis eyes with a startled look in them--\n\n\"My! I never once thought of it, Huck!\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was\nFriday.\"\n\n\"Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got into an\nawful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.\"\n\n\"MIGHT! Better say we WOULD! There's some lucky days, maybe, but\nFriday ain't.\"\n\n\"Any fool knows that. I don't reckon YOU was the first that found it\nout, Huck.\"\n\n\"Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither. I had\na rotten bad dream last night--dreampt about rats.\"\n\n\"No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a sign that\nthere's trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty\nsharp and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing for to-day, and play.\nDo you know Robin Hood, Huck?\"\n\n\"No. Who's Robin Hood?\"\n\n\"Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England--and the\nbest. He was a robber.\"\n\n\"Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?\"\n\n\"Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like.\nBut he never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always divided up with\n'em perfectly square.\"\n\n\"Well, he must 'a' been a brick.\"\n\n\"I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.\nThey ain't any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in\nEngland, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow\nand plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.\"\n\n\"What's a YEW bow?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It's some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that\ndime only on the edge he would set down and cry--and curse. But we'll\nplay Robin Hood--it's nobby fun. I'll learn you.\"\n\n\"I'm agreed.\"\n\nSo they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a\nyearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the\nmorrow's prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink\ninto the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of\nthe trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff\nHill.\n\nOn Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.\nThey had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in\ntheir last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there\nwere so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting\ndown within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and\nturned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this\ntime, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling\nthat they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the\nrequirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.\n\nWhen they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and\ngrisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,\nand something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the\nplace, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they\ncrept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weed-grown,\nfloorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a\nruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and\nabandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened\npulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,\nand muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.\n\nIn a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the\nplace a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own\nboldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look up-stairs.\nThis was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring\neach other, and of course there could be but one result--they threw\ntheir tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same\nsigns of decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised\nmystery, but the promise was a fraud--there was nothing in it. Their\ncourage was up now and well in hand. They were about to go down and\nbegin work when--\n\n\"Sh!\" said Tom.\n\n\"What is it?\" whispered Huck, blanching with fright.\n\n\"Sh! ... There! ... Hear it?\"\n\n\"Yes! ... Oh, my! Let's run!\"\n\n\"Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the door.\"\n\nThe boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to\nknot-holes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.\n\n\"They've stopped.... No--coming.... Here they are. Don't whisper\nanother word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!\"\n\nTwo men entered. Each boy said to himself: \"There's the old deaf and\ndumb Spaniard that's been about town once or twice lately--never saw\nt'other man before.\"\n\n\"T'other\" was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant\nin his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white\nwhiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore\ngreen goggles. When they came in, \"t'other\" was talking in a low voice;\nthey sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the\nwall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less\nguarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"I've thought it all over, and I don't like it. It's\ndangerous.\"\n\n\"Dangerous!\" grunted the \"deaf and dumb\" Spaniard--to the vast\nsurprise of the boys. \"Milksop!\"\n\nThis voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe's! There was\nsilence for some time. Then Joe said:\n\n\"What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder--but nothing's come\nof it.\"\n\n\"That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.\n'Twon't ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn't succeed.\"\n\n\"Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!--anybody\nwould suspicion us that saw us.\"\n\n\"I know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after that\nfool of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only\nit warn't any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys\nplaying over there on the hill right in full view.\"\n\n\"Those infernal boys\" quaked again under the inspiration of this\nremark, and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was\nFriday and concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they\nhad waited a year.\n\nThe two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and\nthoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:\n\n\"Look here, lad--you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there\ntill you hear from me. I'll take the chances on dropping into this town\njust once more, for a look. We'll do that 'dangerous' job after I've\nspied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for\nTexas! We'll leg it together!\"\n\nThis was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun\nJoe said:\n\n\"I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch.\"\n\nHe curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade\nstirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher\nbegan to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore\nnow.\n\nThe boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:\n\n\"Now's our chance--come!\"\n\nHuck said:\n\n\"I can't--I'd die if they was to wake.\"\n\nTom urged--Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and\nstarted alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak\nfrom the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He\nnever made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging\nmoments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity\ngrowing gray; and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun\nwas setting.\n\nNow one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around--smiled grimly\nupon his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees--stirred him\nup with his foot and said:\n\n\"Here! YOU'RE a watchman, ain't you! All right, though--nothing's\nhappened.\"\n\n\"My! have I been asleep?\"\n\n\"Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What'll we\ndo with what little swag we've got left?\"\n\n\"I don't know--leave it here as we've always done, I reckon. No use to\ntake it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver's\nsomething to carry.\"\n\n\"Well--all right--it won't matter to come here once more.\"\n\n\"No--but I'd say come in the night as we used to do--it's better.\"\n\n\"Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right\nchance at that job; accidents might happen; 'tain't in such a very good\nplace; we'll just regularly bury it--and bury it deep.\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,\nraised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that\njingled pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for\nhimself and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter,\nwho was on his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.\n\nThe boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant.\nWith gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!--the splendor of\nit was beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to\nmake half a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the\nhappiest auspices--there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to\nwhere to dig. They nudged each other every moment--eloquent nudges and\neasily understood, for they simply meant--\"Oh, but ain't you glad NOW\nwe're here!\"\n\nJoe's knife struck upon something.\n\n\"Hello!\" said he.\n\n\"What is it?\" said his comrade.\n\n\"Half-rotten plank--no, it's a box, I believe. Here--bear a hand and\nwe'll see what it's here for. Never mind, I've broke a hole.\"\n\nHe reached his hand in and drew it out--\n\n\"Man, it's money!\"\n\nThe two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys\nabove were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.\n\nJoe's comrade said:\n\n\"We'll make quick work of this. There's an old rusty pick over amongst\nthe weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace--I saw it a\nminute ago.\"\n\nHe ran and brought the boys' pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the pick,\nlooked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to\nhimself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was\nnot very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the\nslow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in\nblissful silence.\n\n\"Pard, there's thousands of dollars here,\" said Injun Joe.\n\n\"'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here one\nsummer,\" the stranger observed.\n\n\"I know it,\" said Injun Joe; \"and this looks like it, I should say.\"\n\n\"Now you won't need to do that job.\"\n\nThe half-breed frowned. Said he:\n\n\"You don't know me. Least you don't know all about that thing. 'Tain't\nrobbery altogether--it's REVENGE!\" and a wicked light flamed in his\neyes. \"I'll need your help in it. When it's finished--then Texas. Go\nhome to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.\"\n\n\"Well--if you say so; what'll we do with this--bury it again?\"\n\n\"Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] NO! by the great Sachem, no!\n[Profound distress overhead.] I'd nearly forgot. That pick had fresh\nearth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What\nbusiness has a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth\non them? Who brought them here--and where are they gone? Have you heard\nanybody?--seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and\nsee the ground disturbed? Not exactly--not exactly. We'll take it to my\nden.\"\n\n\"Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number\nOne?\"\n\n\"No--Number Two--under the cross. The other place is bad--too common.\"\n\n\"All right. It's nearly dark enough to start.\"\n\nInjun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously\npeeping out. Presently he said:\n\n\"Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be\nup-stairs?\"\n\nThe boys' breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,\nhalted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The\nboys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came\ncreaking up the stairs--the intolerable distress of the situation woke\nthe stricken resolution of the lads--they were about to spring for the\ncloset, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed\non the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered\nhimself up cursing, and his comrade said:\n\n\"Now what's the use of all that? If it's anybody, and they're up\nthere, let them STAY there--who cares? If they want to jump down, now,\nand get into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes\n--and then let them follow us if they want to. I'm willing. In my\nopinion, whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and\ntook us for ghosts or devils or something. I'll bet they're running\nyet.\"\n\nJoe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight\nwas left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.\nShortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening\ntwilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.\n\nTom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them\nthrough the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they.\nThey were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take\nthe townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too\nmuch absorbed in hating themselves--hating the ill luck that made them\ntake the spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would\nhave suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait\nthere till his \"revenge\" was satisfied, and then he would have had the\nmisfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that\nthe tools were ever brought there!\n\nThey resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come\nto town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him\nto \"Number Two,\" wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought\noccurred to Tom.\n\n\"Revenge? What if he means US, Huck!\"\n\n\"Oh, don't!\" said Huck, nearly fainting.\n\nThey talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to\nbelieve that he might possibly mean somebody else--at least that he\nmight at least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.\n\nVery, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company\nwould be a palpable improvement, he thought.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom's dreams that night.\nFour times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it\nwasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and\nwakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay\nin the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he\nnoticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away--somewhat as if\nthey had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it\noccurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There\nwas one very strong argument in favor of this idea--namely, that the\nquantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen\nas much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys\nof his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references\nto \"hundreds\" and \"thousands\" were mere fanciful forms of speech, and\nthat no such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed\nfor a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found\nin actual money in any one's possession. If his notions of hidden\ntreasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a\nhandful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable\ndollars.\n\nBut the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer\nunder the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found\nhimself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a\ndream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch\na hurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the\ngunwale of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and\nlooking very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the\nsubject. If he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to\nhave been only a dream.\n\n\"Hello, Huck!\"\n\n\"Hello, yourself.\"\n\nSilence, for a minute.\n\n\"Tom, if we'd 'a' left the blame tools at the dead tree, we'd 'a' got\nthe money. Oh, ain't it awful!\"\n\n\"'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.\nDog'd if I don't, Huck.\"\n\n\"What ain't a dream?\"\n\n\"Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.\"\n\n\"Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how much dream\nit was! I've had dreams enough all night--with that patch-eyed Spanish\ndevil going for me all through 'em--rot him!\"\n\n\"No, not rot him. FIND him! Track the money!\"\n\n\"Tom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only one chance for\nsuch a pile--and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty shaky if I was to see\nhim, anyway.\"\n\n\"Well, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway--and track him out--to\nhis Number Two.\"\n\n\"Number Two--yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that. But I can't\nmake nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?\"\n\n\"I dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck--maybe it's the number of a house!\"\n\n\"Goody! ... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this\none-horse town. They ain't no numbers here.\"\n\n\"Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here--it's the number of a\nroom--in a tavern, you know!\"\n\n\"Oh, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can find out\nquick.\"\n\n\"You stay here, Huck, till I come.\"\n\nTom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck's company in public\nplaces. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.\n2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.\nIn the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The\ntavern-keeper's young son said it was kept locked all the time, and he\nnever saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night; he did\nnot know any particular reason for this state of things; had had some\nlittle curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the\nmystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was\n\"ha'nted\"; had noticed that there was a light in there the night before.\n\n\"That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No. 2\nwe're after.\"\n\n\"I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?\"\n\n\"Lemme think.\"\n\nTom thought a long time. Then he said:\n\n\"I'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out\ninto that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap\nof a brick store. Now you get hold of all the door-keys you can find,\nand I'll nip all of auntie's, and the first dark night we'll go there\nand try 'em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he\nsaid he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a\nchance to get his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if\nhe don't go to that No. 2, that ain't the place.\"\n\n\"Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!\"\n\n\"Why, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you--and if he did,\nmaybe he'd never think anything.\"\n\n\"Well, if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him. I dono--I dono.\nI'll try.\"\n\n\"You bet I'll follow him, if it's dark, Huck. Why, he might 'a' found\nout he couldn't get his revenge, and be going right after that money.\"\n\n\"It's so, Tom, it's so. I'll foller him; I will, by jingoes!\"\n\n\"Now you're TALKING! Don't you ever weaken, Huck, and I won't.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nTHAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung\nabout the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the\nalley at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the\nalley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the\ntavern door. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with\nthe understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on,\nHuck was to come and \"maow,\" whereupon he would slip out and try the\nkeys. But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and\nretired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.\n\nTuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday\nnight promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt's\nold tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the\nlantern in Huck's sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before\nmidnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones\nthereabouts) were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had\nentered or left the alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of\ndarkness reigned, the perfect stillness was interrupted only by\noccasional mutterings of distant thunder.\n\nTom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the\ntowel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.\nHuck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was a\nseason of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck's spirits like a\nmountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern--it\nwould frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive\nyet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have\nfainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and\nexcitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and\ncloser to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and\nmomentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away\nhis breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to\ninhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the\nway it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came\ntearing by him: \"Run!\" said he; \"run, for your life!\"\n\nHe needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty\nor forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys\nnever stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house\nat the lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter\nthe storm burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath\nhe said:\n\n\"Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;\nbut they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly\nget my breath I was so scared. They wouldn't turn in the lock, either.\nWell, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and\nopen comes the door! It warn't locked! I hopped in, and shook off the\ntowel, and, GREAT CAESAR'S GHOST!\"\n\n\"What!--what'd you see, Tom?\"\n\n\"Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old\npatch on his eye and his arms spread out.\"\n\n\"Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?\"\n\n\"No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and\nstarted!\"\n\n\"I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!\"\n\n\"Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.\"\n\n\"Say, Tom, did you see that box?\"\n\n\"Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't\nsee the cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the\nfloor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the\nroom. Don't you see, now, what's the matter with that ha'nted room?\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe ALL the Temperance Taverns have\ngot a ha'nted room, hey, Huck?\"\n\n\"Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But\nsay, Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe's\ndrunk.\"\n\n\"It is, that! You try it!\"\n\nHuck shuddered.\n\n\"Well, no--I reckon not.\"\n\n\"And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain't\nenough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it.\"\n\nThere was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:\n\n\"Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun\nJoe's not in there. It's too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we'll\nbe dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we'll\nsnatch that box quicker'n lightning.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do it\nevery night, too, if you'll do the other part of the job.\"\n\n\"All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a\nblock and maow--and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window\nand that'll fetch me.\"\n\n\"Agreed, and good as wheat!\"\n\n\"Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to be\ndaylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every night\nfor a year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night.\"\n\n\"That's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?\"\n\n\"In Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap's nigger man,\nUncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and\nany time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can\nspare it. That's a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don't\never act as if I was above him. Sometime I've set right down and eat\nWITH him. But you needn't tell that. A body's got to do things when\nhe's awful hungry he wouldn't want to do as a steady thing.\"\n\n\"Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I won't\ncome bothering around. Any time you see something's up, in the night,\njust skip right around and maow.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nTHE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news\n--Judge Thatcher's family had come back to town the night before. Both\nInjun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment,\nand Becky took the chief place in the boy's interest. He saw her and\nthey had an exhausting good time playing \"hi-spy\" and \"gully-keeper\"\nwith a crowd of their school-mates. The day was completed and crowned\nin a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint\nthe next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she\nconsented. The child's delight was boundless; and Tom's not more\nmoderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway\nthe young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation\nand pleasurable anticipation. Tom's excitement enabled him to keep\nawake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck's\n\"maow,\" and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers\nwith, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.\n\nMorning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and\nrollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and everything\nwas ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar\nthe picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe\nenough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few\nyoung gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferryboat\nwas chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the\nmain street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss\nthe fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.\nThatcher said to Becky, was:\n\n\"You'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all night\nwith some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.\"\n\n\"Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.\"\n\n\"Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any trouble.\"\n\nPresently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:\n\n\"Say--I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe Harper's\nwe'll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas'. She'll\nhave ice-cream! She has it most every day--dead loads of it. And she'll\nbe awful glad to have us.\"\n\n\"Oh, that will be fun!\"\n\nThen Becky reflected a moment and said:\n\n\"But what will mamma say?\"\n\n\"How'll she ever know?\"\n\nThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:\n\n\"I reckon it's wrong--but--\"\n\n\"But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All she\nwants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go there if\nshe'd 'a' thought of it. I know she would!\"\n\nThe Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and\nTom's persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say\nnothing anybody about the night's programme. Presently it occurred to\nTom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The\nthought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he\ncould not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas'. And why should he\ngive it up, he reasoned--the signal did not come the night before, so\nwhy should it be any more likely to come to-night? The sure fun of the\nevening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined\nto yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of\nthe box of money another time that day.\n\nThree miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody\nhollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest\ndistances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and\nlaughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone\nthrough with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified\nwith responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things\nbegan. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat\nin the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:\n\n\"Who's ready for the cave?\"\n\nEverybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there\nwas a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the\nhillside--an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door\nstood unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an ice-house, and\nwalled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat.\nIt was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look\nout upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of\nthe situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment\na candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a\nstruggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon\nknocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter\nand a new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession\nwent filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering\nrank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their\npoint of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more\nthan eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still\nnarrower crevices branched from it on either hand--for McDougal's cave\nwas but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and\nout again and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and\nnights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and\nnever find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down,\nand still down, into the earth, and it was just the same--labyrinth\nunder labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man \"knew\" the cave.\nThat was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of\nit, and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion.\nTom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one.\n\nThe procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a\nmile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch\navenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by\nsurprise at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able\nto elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond\nthe \"known\" ground.\n\nBy-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth\nof the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow\ndrippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of\nthe day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no\nnote of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had\nbeen calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day's\nadventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat\nwith her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for\nthe wasted time but the captain of the craft.\n\nHuck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat's lights went\nglinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young\npeople were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly\ntired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not stop\nat the wharf--and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his\nattention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten\no'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began\nto wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village\nbetook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the\nsilence and the ghosts. Eleven o'clock came, and the tavern lights were\nput out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long\ntime, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?\nWas there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?\n\nA noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The\nalley door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store.\nThe next moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have\nsomething under his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to\nremove the treasure. Why call Tom now? It would be absurd--the men\nwould get away with the box and never be found again. No, he would\nstick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the darkness for\nsecurity from discovery. So communing with himself, Huck stepped out\nand glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing\nthem to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.\n\nThey moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left\nup a cross-street. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to\nthe path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the\nold Welshman's house, half-way up the hill, without hesitating, and\nstill climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old\nquarry. But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the\nsummit. They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach\nbushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and\nshortened his distance, now, for they would never be able to see him.\nHe trotted along awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was\ngaining too fast; moved on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened;\nno sound; none, save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own\nheart. The hooting of an owl came over the hill--ominous sound! But no\nfootsteps. Heavens, was everything lost! He was about to spring with\nwinged feet, when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him!\nHuck's heart shot into his throat, but he swallowed it again; and then\nhe stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at\nonce, and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground. He\nknew where he was. He knew he was within five steps of the stile\nleading into Widow Douglas' grounds. Very well, he thought, let them\nbury it there; it won't be hard to find.\n\nNow there was a voice--a very low voice--Injun Joe's:\n\n\"Damn her, maybe she's got company--there's lights, late as it is.\"\n\n\"I can't see any.\"\n\nThis was that stranger's voice--the stranger of the haunted house. A\ndeadly chill went to Huck's heart--this, then, was the \"revenge\" job!\nHis thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had\nbeen kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to\nmurder her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he\ndidn't dare--they might come and catch him. He thought all this and\nmore in the moment that elapsed between the stranger's remark and Injun\nJoe's next--which was--\n\n\"Because the bush is in your way. Now--this way--now you see, don't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes. Well, there IS company there, I reckon. Better give it up.\"\n\n\"Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and\nmaybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I've told you\nbefore, I don't care for her swag--you may have it. But her husband was\nrough on me--many times he was rough on me--and mainly he was the\njustice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain't all.\nIt ain't a millionth part of it! He had me HORSEWHIPPED!--horsewhipped\nin front of the jail, like a nigger!--with all the town looking on!\nHORSEWHIPPED!--do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But\nI'll take it out of HER.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't kill her! Don't do that!\"\n\n\"Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill HIM if he was\nhere; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don't\nkill her--bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils--you notch\nher ears like a sow!\"\n\n\"By God, that's--\"\n\n\"Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I'll tie\nher to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I'll not cry,\nif she does. My friend, you'll help me in this thing--for MY sake\n--that's why you're here--I mightn't be able alone. If you flinch, I'll\nkill you. Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I'll kill\nher--and then I reckon nobody'll ever know much about who done this\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Well, if it's got to be done, let's get at it. The quicker the\nbetter--I'm all in a shiver.\"\n\n\"Do it NOW? And company there? Look here--I'll get suspicious of you,\nfirst thing you know. No--we'll wait till the lights are out--there's\nno hurry.\"\n\nHuck felt that a silence was going to ensue--a thing still more awful\nthan any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped\ngingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,\none-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one\nside and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same\nelaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and--a twig\nsnapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was\nno sound--the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now\nhe turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes--turned\nhimself as carefully as if he were a ship--and then stepped quickly but\ncautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and so\nhe picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he\nreached the Welshman's. He banged at the door, and presently the heads\nof the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.\n\n\"What's the row there? Who's banging? What do you want?\"\n\n\"Let me in--quick! I'll tell everything.\"\n\n\"Why, who are you?\"\n\n\"Huckleberry Finn--quick, let me in!\"\n\n\"Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors, I\njudge! But let him in, lads, and let's see what's the trouble.\"\n\n\"Please don't ever tell I told you,\" were Huck's first words when he\ngot in. \"Please don't--I'd be killed, sure--but the widow's been good\nfriends to me sometimes, and I want to tell--I WILL tell if you'll\npromise you won't ever say it was me.\"\n\n\"By George, he HAS got something to tell, or he wouldn't act so!\"\nexclaimed the old man; \"out with it and nobody here'll ever tell, lad.\"\n\nThree minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the\nhill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in\ntheir hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great\nbowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence,\nand then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.\n\nHuck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill\nas fast as his legs could carry him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nAS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck\ncame groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman's door.\nThe inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a\nhair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call\ncame from a window:\n\n\"Who's there!\"\n\nHuck's scared voice answered in a low tone:\n\n\"Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!\"\n\n\"It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad!--and welcome!\"\n\nThese were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the\npleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing\nword had ever been applied in his case before. The door was quickly\nunlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his\nbrace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.\n\n\"Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be\nready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too\n--make yourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and\nstop here last night.\"\n\n\"I was awful scared,\" said Huck, \"and I run. I took out when the\npistols went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz\nI wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I\ndidn't want to run across them devils, even if they was dead.\"\n\n\"Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it--but\nthere's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast. No, they\nain't dead, lad--we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right\nwhere to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along\non tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them--dark as a cellar\nthat sumach path was--and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It\nwas the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use\n--'twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol\nraised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get\nout of the path, I sung out, 'Fire boys!' and blazed away at the place\nwhere the rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy,\nthose villains, and we after them, down through the woods. I judge we\nnever touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they started, but their\nbullets whizzed by and didn't do us any harm. As soon as we lost the\nsound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the\nconstables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river\nbank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to\nbeat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we had\nsome sort of description of those rascals--'twould help a good deal.\nBut you couldn't see what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh yes; I saw them down-town and follered them.\"\n\n\"Splendid! Describe them--describe them, my boy!\"\n\n\"One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or\ntwice, and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged--\"\n\n\"That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods\nback of the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys,\nand tell the sheriff--get your breakfast to-morrow morning!\"\n\nThe Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room\nHuck sprang up and exclaimed:\n\n\"Oh, please don't tell ANYbody it was me that blowed on them! Oh,\nplease!\"\n\n\"All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of\nwhat you did.\"\n\n\"Oh no, no! Please don't tell!\"\n\nWhen the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:\n\n\"They won't tell--and I won't. But why don't you want it known?\"\n\nHuck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too\nmuch about one of those men and would not have the man know that he\nknew anything against him for the whole world--he would be killed for\nknowing it, sure.\n\nThe old man promised secrecy once more, and said:\n\n\"How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking\nsuspicious?\"\n\nHuck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:\n\n\"Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot,--least everybody says so,\nand I don't see nothing agin it--and sometimes I can't sleep much, on\naccount of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way\nof doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I\ncome along up-street 'bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I\ngot to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed\nup agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes\nthese two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their\narm, and I reckoned they'd stole it. One was a-smoking, and t'other one\nwanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up\ntheir faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,\nby his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t'other one was a\nrusty, ragged-looking devil.\"\n\n\"Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?\"\n\nThis staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:\n\n\"Well, I don't know--but somehow it seems as if I did.\"\n\n\"Then they went on, and you--\"\n\n\"Follered 'em--yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up--they\nsneaked along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and stood in the\ndark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard\nswear he'd spile her looks just as I told you and your two--\"\n\n\"What! The DEAF AND DUMB man said all that!\"\n\nHuck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep\nthe old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might\nbe, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in\nspite of all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his\nscrape, but the old man's eye was upon him and he made blunder after\nblunder. Presently the Welshman said:\n\n\"My boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head\nfor all the world. No--I'd protect you--I'd protect you. This Spaniard\nis not deaf and dumb; you've let that slip without intending it; you\ncan't cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that\nyou want to keep dark. Now trust me--tell me what it is, and trust me\n--I won't betray you.\"\n\nHuck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent over\nand whispered in his ear:\n\n\"'Tain't a Spaniard--it's Injun Joe!\"\n\nThe Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:\n\n\"It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and\nslitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because\nwhite men don't take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a\ndifferent matter altogether.\"\n\nDuring breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man\nsaid that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going\nto bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for\nmarks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of--\n\n\"Of WHAT?\"\n\nIf the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more\nstunning suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were staring\nwide, now, and his breath suspended--waiting for the answer. The\nWelshman started--stared in return--three seconds--five seconds--ten\n--then replied:\n\n\"Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the MATTER with you?\"\n\nHuck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The\nWelshman eyed him gravely, curiously--and presently said:\n\n\"Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But\nwhat did give you that turn? What were YOU expecting we'd found?\"\n\nHuck was in a close place--the inquiring eye was upon him--he would\nhave given anything for material for a plausible answer--nothing\nsuggested itself--the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper--a\nsenseless reply offered--there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture\nhe uttered it--feebly:\n\n\"Sunday-school books, maybe.\"\n\nPoor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud\nand joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot,\nand ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man's pocket,\nbecause it cut down the doctor's bill like everything. Then he added:\n\n\"Poor old chap, you're white and jaded--you ain't well a bit--no\nwonder you're a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll come\nout of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.\"\n\nHuck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such\na suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel\nbrought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the\ntalk at the widow's stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,\nhowever--he had not known that it wasn't--and so the suggestion of a\ncaptured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole\nhe felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond\nall question that that bundle was not THE bundle, and so his mind was\nat rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be\ndrifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still\nin No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom\ncould seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of\ninterruption.\n\nJust as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck\njumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even\nremotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and\ngentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of\ncitizens were climbing up the hill--to stare at the stile. So the news\nhad spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the\nvisitors. The widow's gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.\n\n\"Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're more\nbeholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don't allow\nme to tell his name. We wouldn't have been there but for him.\"\n\nOf course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled\nthe main matter--but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of\nhis visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he\nrefused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the\nwidow said:\n\n\"I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that\nnoise. Why didn't you come and wake me?\"\n\n\"We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to come\nagain--they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use of\nwaking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard\nat your house all the rest of the night. They've just come back.\"\n\nMore visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a\ncouple of hours more.\n\nThere was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody\nwas early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came\nthat not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the\nsermon was finished, Judge Thatcher's wife dropped alongside of Mrs.\nHarper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:\n\n\"Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be\ntired to death.\"\n\n\"Your Becky?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" with a startled look--\"didn't she stay with you last night?\"\n\n\"Why, no.\"\n\nMrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,\ntalking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:\n\n\"Good-morning, Mrs. Thatcher. Good-morning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a\nboy that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last\nnight--one of you. And now he's afraid to come to church. I've got to\nsettle with him.\"\n\nMrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.\n\n\"He didn't stay with us,\" said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy.\nA marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.\n\n\"Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?\"\n\n\"No'm.\"\n\n\"When did you see him last?\"\n\nJoe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had\nstopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding\nuneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were\nanxiously questioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not\nnoticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the\nhomeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was\nmissing. One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were\nstill in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to\ncrying and wringing her hands.\n\nThe alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to\nstreet, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the\nwhole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant\ninsignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled,\nskiffs were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror\nwas half an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and\nriver toward the cave.\n\nAll the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women\nvisited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They\ncried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the\ntedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at\nlast, all the word that came was, \"Send more candles--and send food.\"\nMrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher\nsent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they\nconveyed no real cheer.\n\nThe old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with\ncandle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck\nstill in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with\nfever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came\nand took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,\nbecause, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord's,\nand nothing that was the Lord's was a thing to be neglected. The\nWelshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:\n\n\"You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it off.\nHe never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his\nhands.\"\n\nEarly in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the\nvillage, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the\nnews that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were\nbeing ransacked that had never been visited before; that every corner\nand crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one\nwandered through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting\nhither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent\ntheir hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one\nplace, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names\n\"BECKY & TOM\" had been found traced upon the rocky wall with\ncandle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs.\nThatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the\nlast relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial\nof her could ever be so precious, because this one parted latest from\nthe living body before the awful death came. Some said that now and\nthen, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a\nglorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the\nechoing aisle--and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the\nchildren were not there; it was only a searcher's light.\n\nThree dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and\nthe village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.\nThe accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the\nTemperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the\npublic pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck\nfeebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked--dimly\ndreading the worst--if anything had been discovered at the Temperance\nTavern since he had been ill.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the widow.\n\nHuck started up in bed, wild-eyed:\n\n\"What? What was it?\"\n\n\"Liquor!--and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child--what a turn\nyou did give me!\"\n\n\"Only tell me just one thing--only just one--please! Was it Tom Sawyer\nthat found it?\"\n\nThe widow burst into tears. \"Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you\nbefore, you must NOT talk. You are very, very sick!\"\n\nThen nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great\npowwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever--gone\nforever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should\ncry.\n\nThese thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the\nweariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:\n\n\"There--he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody\ncould find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now, that's got hope\nenough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nNOW to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic. They tripped\nalong the murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the\nfamiliar wonders of the cave--wonders dubbed with rather\nover-descriptive names, such as \"The Drawing-Room,\" \"The Cathedral,\"\n\"Aladdin's Palace,\" and so on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking\nbegan, and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion\nbegan to grow a trifle wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous\navenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled web-work of\nnames, dates, post-office addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky\nwalls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and\ntalking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave\nwhose walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an\noverhanging shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a\nlittle stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone\nsediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and\nruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his\nsmall body behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky's\ngratification. He found that it curtained a sort of steep natural\nstairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at once the\nambition to be a discoverer seized him. Becky responded to his call,\nand they made a smoke-mark for future guidance, and started upon their\nquest. They wound this way and that, far down into the secret depths of\nthe cave, made another mark, and branched off in search of novelties to\ntell the upper world about. In one place they found a spacious cavern,\nfrom whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the\nlength and circumference of a man's leg; they walked all about it,\nwondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous\npassages that opened into it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching\nspring, whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering\ncrystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by\nmany fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great\nstalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless\nwater-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed\nthemselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the\ncreatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and\ndarting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of\nthis sort of conduct. He seized Becky's hand and hurried her into the\nfirst corridor that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck\nBecky's light out with its wing while she was passing out of the\ncavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the fugitives\nplunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got rid of the\nperilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly, which\nstretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows.\nHe wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best\nto sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the deep\nstillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the\nchildren. Becky said:\n\n\"Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of\nthe others.\"\n\n\"Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them--and I don't know\nhow far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn't\nhear them here.\"\n\nBecky grew apprehensive.\n\n\"I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start back.\"\n\n\"Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better.\"\n\n\"Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me.\"\n\n\"I reckon I could find it--but then the bats. If they put our candles\nout it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so as not to go\nthrough there.\"\n\n\"Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!\" and the\ngirl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.\n\nThey started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long\nway, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything\nfamiliar about the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time\nTom made an examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging\nsign, and he would say cheerily:\n\n\"Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right\naway!\"\n\nBut he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently\nbegan to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate\nhope of finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was \"all\nright,\" but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words\nhad lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said, \"All is lost!\"\nBecky clung to his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep\nback the tears, but they would come. At last she said:\n\n\"Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem to get\nworse and worse off all the time.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" said he.\n\nProfound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were\nconspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the\nempty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that\nresembled a ripple of mocking laughter.\n\n\"Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,\" said Becky.\n\n\"It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,\" and\nhe shouted again.\n\nThe \"might\" was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it\nso confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened;\nbut there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and\nhurried his steps. It was but a little while before a certain\nindecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky--he\ncould not find his way back!\n\n\"Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!\"\n\n\"Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want\nto come back! No--I can't find the way. It's all mixed up.\"\n\n\"Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this awful\nplace! Oh, why DID we ever leave the others!\"\n\nShe sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom\nwas appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He\nsat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his\nbosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing\nregrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom\nbegged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell\nto blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable\nsituation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope\nagain, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he\nwould not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than\nshe, she said.\n\nSo they moved on again--aimlessly--simply at random--all they could do\nwas to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of\nreviving--not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its\nnature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age\nand familiarity with failure.\n\nBy-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy meant\nso much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died\nagain. She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in\nhis pockets--yet he must economize.\n\nBy-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to\npay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time\nwas grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any\ndirection, was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down\nwas to invite death and shorten its pursuit.\n\nAt last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat\ndown. Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends\nthere, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried,\nand Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his\nencouragements were grown threadbare with use, and sounded like\nsarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to\nsleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it\ngrow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and\nby-and-by a smile dawned and rested there. The peaceful face reflected\nsomewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts\nwandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories. While he was deep in\nhis musings, Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh--but it was\nstricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed it.\n\n\"Oh, how COULD I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I\ndon't, Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find\nthe way out.\"\n\n\"We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream.\nI reckon we are going there.\"\n\n\"Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying.\"\n\nThey rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried\nto estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was\nthat it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not\nbe, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this--they\ncould not tell how long--Tom said they must go softly and listen for\ndripping water--they must find a spring. They found one presently, and\nTom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky\nsaid she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to\nhear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom\nfastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay.\nThought was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke\nthe silence:\n\n\"Tom, I am so hungry!\"\n\nTom took something out of his pocket.\n\n\"Do you remember this?\" said he.\n\nBecky almost smiled.\n\n\"It's our wedding-cake, Tom.\"\n\n\"Yes--I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've got.\"\n\n\"I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grown-up\npeople do with wedding-cake--but it'll be our--\"\n\nShe dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky\nate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was\nabundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky\nsuggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he\nsaid:\n\n\"Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?\"\n\nBecky's face paled, but she thought she could.\n\n\"Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink.\nThat little piece is our last candle!\"\n\nBecky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to\ncomfort her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:\n\n\"Tom!\"\n\n\"Well, Becky?\"\n\n\"They'll miss us and hunt for us!\"\n\n\"Yes, they will! Certainly they will!\"\n\n\"Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom.\"\n\n\"Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.\"\n\n\"When would they miss us, Tom?\"\n\n\"When they get back to the boat, I reckon.\"\n\n\"Tom, it might be dark then--would they notice we hadn't come?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they\ngot home.\"\n\nA frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and he saw\nthat he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!\nThe children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of\ngrief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers\nalso--that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher\ndiscovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper's.\n\nThe children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched\nit melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand\nalone at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin\ncolumn of smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then--the horror of\nutter darkness reigned!\n\nHow long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that\nshe was crying in Tom's arms, neither could tell. All that they knew\nwas, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of\na dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said\nit might be Sunday, now--maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk,\nbut her sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said\nthat they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was\ngoing on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it;\nbut in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he\ntried it no more.\n\nThe hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again.\nA portion of Tom's half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it.\nBut they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only\nwhetted desire.\n\nBy-and-by Tom said:\n\n\"SH! Did you hear that?\"\n\nBoth held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the\nfaintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky\nby the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction.\nPresently he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently\na little nearer.\n\n\"It's them!\" said Tom; \"they're coming! Come along, Becky--we're all\nright now!\"\n\nThe joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was\nslow, however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be\nguarded against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be\nthree feet deep, it might be a hundred--there was no passing it at any\nrate. Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could.\nNo bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They\nlistened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant! a\nmoment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking\nmisery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He\ntalked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no\nsounds came again.\n\nThe children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time\ndragged on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom\nbelieved it must be Tuesday by this time.\n\nNow an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It\nwould be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the\nheavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to\na projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the\nline as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended\nin a \"jumping-off place.\" Tom got down on his knees and felt below, and\nthen as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands\nconveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the\nright, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding\na candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,\nand instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to--Injun\nJoe's! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified\nthe next moment, to see the \"Spaniard\" take to his heels and get\nhimself out of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his\nvoice and come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the\nechoes must have disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he\nreasoned. Tom's fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to\nhimself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he\nwould stay there, and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of\nmeeting Injun Joe again. He was careful to keep from Becky what it was\nhe had seen. He told her he had only shouted \"for luck.\"\n\nBut hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.\nAnother tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought\nchanges. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed\nthat it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,\nand that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another\npassage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But\nBecky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be\nroused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die--it would\nnot be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he\nchose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak\nto her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he\nwould stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.\n\nTom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a\nshow of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the\ncave; then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one\nof the passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick\nwith bodings of coming doom.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nTUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.\nPetersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public\nprayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private\nprayer that had the petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good\nnews came from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the\nquest and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain\nthe children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a\ngreat part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to\nhear her call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute\nat a time, then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had\ndrooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost\nwhite. The village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.\n\nAway in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village\nbells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad\npeople, who shouted, \"Turn out! turn out! they're found! they're\nfound!\" Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed\nitself and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open\ncarriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its\nhomeward march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring\nhuzzah after huzzah!\n\nThe village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the\ngreatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour\na procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's house, seized\nthe saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher's hand, tried to\nspeak but couldn't--and drifted out raining tears all over the place.\n\nAunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so. It\nwould be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with\nthe great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay\nupon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of\nthe wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it\nwithal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on\nan exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his\nkite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of\nthe kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off\nspeck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,\npushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad\nMississippi rolling by! And if it had only happened to be night he would\nnot have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that\npassage any more! He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good\nnews and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was\ntired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to. He described how he\nlabored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when\nshe had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how\nhe pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat\nthere and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom\nhailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition;\nhow the men didn't believe the wild tale at first, \"because,\" said they,\n\"you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in\"\n--then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them\nrest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.\n\nBefore day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him\nwere tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung\nbehind them, and informed of the great news.\n\nThree days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be\nshaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were\nbedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and\nmore tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on\nThursday, was down-town Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday;\nbut Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as\nif she had passed through a wasting illness.\n\nTom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but\ncould not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or\nSunday. He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still\nabout his adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas\nstayed by to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff\nHill event; also that the \"ragged man's\" body had eventually been found\nin the river near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying\nto escape, perhaps.\n\nAbout a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started off to\nvisit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting\ntalk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge\nThatcher's house was on Tom's way, and he stopped to see Becky. The\nJudge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him\nironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave again. Tom said he\nthought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said:\n\n\"Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt.\nBut we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago,\nand triple-locked--and I've got the keys.\"\n\nTom turned as white as a sheet.\n\n\"What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!\"\n\nThe water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.\n\n\"Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?\"\n\n\"Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nWITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of\nmen were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the ferryboat, well\nfilled with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that\nbore Judge Thatcher.\n\nWhen the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in\nthe dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,\ndead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing\neyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer\nof the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own\nexperience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but\nnevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,\nwhich revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated\nbefore how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day\nhe lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.\n\nInjun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The\ngreat foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through,\nwith tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock\nformed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had\nwrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if\nthere had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been\nuseless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could\nnot have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had\nonly hacked that place in order to be doing something--in order to pass\nthe weary time--in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily\none could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices\nof this vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The\nprisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to\ncatch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their\nclaws. The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at\nhand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages,\nbuilded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had\nbroken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone,\nwherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop\nthat fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a\nclock-tick--a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop\nwas falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the\nfoundations of Rome were laid when Christ was crucified; when the\nConqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the\nmassacre at Lexington was \"news.\" It is falling now; it will still be\nfalling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of\nhistory, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the\nthick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did\nthis drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for\nthis flitting human insect's need? and has it another important object\nto accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. It is many and\nmany a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch\nthe priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that\npathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the\nwonders of McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands first in the list of\nthe cavern's marvels; even \"Aladdin's Palace\" cannot rival it.\n\nInjun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked\nthere in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and\nhamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and all\nsorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as\nsatisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the\nhanging.\n\nThis funeral stopped the further growth of one thing--the petition to\nthe governor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had been largely\nsigned; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a\ncommittee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail\naround the governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample\nhis duty under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five\ncitizens of the village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself\nthere would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names\nto a pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently\nimpaired and leaky water-works.\n\nThe morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have\nan important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the\nWelshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned\nthere was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he\nwanted to talk about now. Huck's face saddened. He said:\n\n\"I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but\nwhiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben\nyou, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you\nhadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way or other and\ntold me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something's always\ntold me we'd never get holt of that swag.\"\n\n\"Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. YOU know his tavern\nwas all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you remember you\nwas to watch there that night?\"\n\n\"Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night that I\nfollered Injun Joe to the widder's.\"\n\n\"YOU followed him?\"\n\n\"Yes--but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him,\nand I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it\nhadn't ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all right.\"\n\nThen Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only\nheard of the Welshman's part of it before.\n\n\"Well,\" said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question,\n\"whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon\n--anyways it's a goner for us, Tom.\"\n\n\"Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!\"\n\n\"What!\" Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. \"Tom, have you got on\nthe track of that money again?\"\n\n\"Huck, it's in the cave!\"\n\nHuck's eyes blazed.\n\n\"Say it again, Tom.\"\n\n\"The money's in the cave!\"\n\n\"Tom--honest injun, now--is it fun, or earnest?\"\n\n\"Earnest, Huck--just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go\nin there with me and help get it out?\"\n\n\"I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not\nget lost.\"\n\n\"Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's--\"\n\n\"Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll\nagree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the world. I\nwill, by jings.\"\n\n\"All right--it's a whiz. When do you say?\"\n\n\"Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?\"\n\n\"Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,\nnow, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom--least I don't think I could.\"\n\n\"It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go,\nHuck, but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me\nknow about. Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff. I'll float the\nskiff down there, and I'll pull it back again all by myself. You\nneedn't ever turn your hand over.\"\n\n\"Less start right off, Tom.\"\n\n\"All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little\nbag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these\nnew-fangled things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's\nthe time I wished I had some when I was in there before.\"\n\nA trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who\nwas absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles\nbelow \"Cave Hollow,\" Tom said:\n\n\"Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the\ncave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see\nthat white place up yonder where there's been a landslide? Well, that's\none of my marks. We'll get ashore, now.\"\n\nThey landed.\n\n\"Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out\nof with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.\"\n\nHuck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly\nmarched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:\n\n\"Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this\ncountry. You just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to be\na robber, but I knew I'd got to have a thing like this, and where to\nrun across it was the bother. We've got it now, and we'll keep it\nquiet, only we'll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in--because of course\nthere's got to be a Gang, or else there wouldn't be any style about it.\nTom Sawyer's Gang--it sounds splendid, don't it, Huck?\"\n\n\"Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?\"\n\n\"Oh, most anybody. Waylay people--that's mostly the way.\"\n\n\"And kill them?\"\n\n\"No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.\"\n\n\"What's a ransom?\"\n\n\"Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and\nafter you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them.\nThat's the general way. Only you don't kill the women. You shut up the\nwomen, but you don't kill them. They're always beautiful and rich, and\nawfully scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take\nyour hat off and talk polite. They ain't anybody as polite as robbers\n--you'll see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and\nafter they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and\nafter that you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd\nturn right around and come back. It's so in all the books.\"\n\n\"Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a pirate.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and\ncircuses and all that.\"\n\nBy this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom\nin the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel,\nthen made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps\nbrought them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through\nhim. He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of\nclay against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the\nflame struggle and expire.\n\nThe boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and\ngloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently\nentered and followed Tom's other corridor until they reached the\n\"jumping-off place.\" The candles revealed the fact that it was not\nreally a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet\nhigh. Tom whispered:\n\n\"Now I'll show you something, Huck.\"\n\nHe held his candle aloft and said:\n\n\"Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There--on\nthe big rock over yonder--done with candle-smoke.\"\n\n\"Tom, it's a CROSS!\"\n\n\"NOW where's your Number Two? 'UNDER THE CROSS,' hey? Right yonder's\nwhere I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!\"\n\nHuck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:\n\n\"Tom, less git out of here!\"\n\n\"What! and leave the treasure?\"\n\n\"Yes--leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there, certain.\"\n\n\"No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where he\ndied--away out at the mouth of the cave--five mile from here.\"\n\n\"No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the ways\nof ghosts, and so do you.\"\n\nTom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his\nmind. But presently an idea occurred to him--\n\n\"Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun Joe's\nghost ain't a going to come around where there's a cross!\"\n\nThe point was well taken. It had its effect.\n\n\"Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that\ncross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.\"\n\nTom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.\nHuck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the\ngreat rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.\nThey found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with\na pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some\nbacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there\nwas no money-box. The lads searched and researched this place, but in\nvain. Tom said:\n\n\"He said UNDER the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the\ncross. It can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on\nthe ground.\"\n\nThey searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged.\nHuck could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:\n\n\"Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle-grease on the\nclay about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now,\nwhat's that for? I bet you the money IS under the rock. I'm going to\ndig in the clay.\"\n\n\"That ain't no bad notion, Tom!\" said Huck with animation.\n\nTom's \"real Barlow\" was out at once, and he had not dug four inches\nbefore he struck wood.\n\n\"Hey, Huck!--you hear that?\"\n\nHuck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and\nremoved. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.\nTom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he\ncould, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed to\nexplore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended\ngradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to\nthe left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and\nexclaimed:\n\n\"My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!\"\n\nIt was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,\nalong with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two\nor three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish\nwell soaked with the water-drip.\n\n\"Got it at last!\" said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with\nhis hand. \"My, but we're rich, Tom!\"\n\n\"Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe,\nbut we HAVE got it, sure! Say--let's not fool around here. Let's snake\nit out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.\"\n\nIt weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward\nfashion, but could not carry it conveniently.\n\n\"I thought so,\" he said; \"THEY carried it like it was heavy, that day\nat the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of\nfetching the little bags along.\"\n\nThe money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross\nrock.\n\n\"Now less fetch the guns and things,\" said Huck.\n\n\"No, Huck--leave them there. They're just the tricks to have when we\ngo to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our\norgies there, too. It's an awful snug place for orgies.\"\n\n\"What orgies?\"\n\n\"I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got to\nhave them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's\ngetting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke when we\nget to the skiff.\"\n\nThey presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily\nout, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the\nskiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got\nunder way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting\ncheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.\n\n\"Now, Huck,\" said Tom, \"we'll hide the money in the loft of the\nwidow's woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it\nand divide, and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it\nwhere it will be safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till\nI run and hook Benny Taylor's little wagon; I won't be gone a minute.\"\n\nHe disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two\nsmall sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started\noff, dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the\nWelshman's house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move\non, the Welshman stepped out and said:\n\n\"Hallo, who's that?\"\n\n\"Huck and Tom Sawyer.\"\n\n\"Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.\nHere--hurry up, trot ahead--I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's not\nas light as it might be. Got bricks in it?--or old metal?\"\n\n\"Old metal,\" said Tom.\n\n\"I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool\naway more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the\nfoundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. But\nthat's human nature--hurry along, hurry along!\"\n\nThe boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.\n\n\"Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'.\"\n\nHuck said with some apprehension--for he was long used to being\nfalsely accused:\n\n\"Mr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing.\"\n\nThe Welshman laughed.\n\n\"Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that. Ain't you\nand the widow good friends?\"\n\n\"Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway.\"\n\n\"All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?\"\n\nThis question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind before he\nfound himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas' drawing-room.\nMr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.\n\nThe place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any\nconsequence in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the\nHarpers, the Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor,\nand a great many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow\nreceived the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such\nlooking beings. They were covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt\nPolly blushed crimson with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head\nat Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr.\nJones said:\n\n\"Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and\nHuck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.\"\n\n\"And you did just right,\" said the widow. \"Come with me, boys.\"\n\nShe took them to a bedchamber and said:\n\n\"Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes\n--shirts, socks, everything complete. They're Huck's--no, no thanks,\nHuck--Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they'll fit both of you.\nGet into them. We'll wait--come down when you are slicked up enough.\"\n\nThen she left.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nHUCK said: \"Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain't\nhigh from the ground.\"\n\n\"Shucks! what do you want to slope for?\"\n\n\"Well, I ain't used to that kind of a crowd. I can't stand it. I ain't\ngoing down there, Tom.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother! It ain't anything. I don't mind it a bit. I'll take care\nof you.\"\n\nSid appeared.\n\n\"Tom,\" said he, \"auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon.\nMary got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's been fretting about\nyou. Say--ain't this grease and clay, on your clothes?\"\n\n\"Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's all this\nblow-out about, anyway?\"\n\n\"It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having. This time\nit's for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they\nhelped her out of the other night. And say--I can tell you something,\nif you want to know.\"\n\n\"Well, what?\"\n\n\"Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people\nhere to-night, but I overheard him tell auntie to-day about it, as a\nsecret, but I reckon it's not much of a secret now. Everybody knows\n--the widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don't. Mr. Jones was\nbound Huck should be here--couldn't get along with his grand secret\nwithout Huck, you know!\"\n\n\"Secret about what, Sid?\"\n\n\"About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr. Jones\nwas going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will\ndrop pretty flat.\"\n\nSid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.\n\n\"Sid, was it you that told?\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind who it was. SOMEBODY told--that's enough.\"\n\n\"Sid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and\nthat's you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a' sneaked down the\nhill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can't do any but mean\nthings, and you can't bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.\nThere--no thanks, as the widow says\"--and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and\nhelped him to the door with several kicks. \"Now go and tell auntie if\nyou dare--and to-morrow you'll catch it!\"\n\nSome minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper-table, and a\ndozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,\nafter the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.\nJones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the\nhonor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was\nanother person whose modesty--\n\nAnd so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck's share in the\nadventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the\nsurprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and\neffusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,\nthe widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many\ncompliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the\nnearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely\nintolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody's gaze\nand everybody's laudations.\n\nThe widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have\nhim educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start\nhim in business in a modest way. Tom's chance was come. He said:\n\n\"Huck don't need it. Huck's rich.\"\n\nNothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept\nback the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But\nthe silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:\n\n\"Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots of\nit. Oh, you needn't smile--I reckon I can show you. You just wait a\nminute.\"\n\nTom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a\nperplexed interest--and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.\n\n\"Sid, what ails Tom?\" said Aunt Polly. \"He--well, there ain't ever any\nmaking of that boy out. I never--\"\n\nTom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly\ndid not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon\nthe table and said:\n\n\"There--what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of it's mine!\"\n\nThe spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke\nfor a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom\nsaid he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of\ninterest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the\ncharm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:\n\n\"I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it\ndon't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I'm\nwilling to allow.\"\n\nThe money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve\nthousand dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one\ntime before, though several persons were there who were worth\nconsiderably more than that in property.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nTHE reader may rest satisfied that Tom's and Huck's windfall made a\nmighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a\nsum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked\nabout, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the\ncitizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every\n\"haunted\" house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was\ndissected, plank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for\nhidden treasure--and not by boys, but men--pretty grave, unromantic\nmen, too, some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were\ncourted, admired, stared at. The boys were not able to remember that\ntheir remarks had possessed weight before; but now their sayings were\ntreasured and repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be\nregarded as remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and\nsaying commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up\nand discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village\npaper published biographical sketches of the boys.\n\nThe Widow Douglas put Huck's money out at six per cent., and Judge\nThatcher did the same with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request. Each lad had\nan income, now, that was simply prodigious--a dollar for every week-day\nin the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got\n--no, it was what he was promised--he generally couldn't collect it. A\ndollar and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in\nthose old simple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that\nmatter.\n\nJudge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no\ncommonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When\nBecky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her\nwhipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded\ngrace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that\nwhipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine\noutburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie--a lie that\nwas worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to\nbreast with George Washington's lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky\nthought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he\nwalked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight\noff and told Tom about it.\n\nJudge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some\nday. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the\nNational Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school\nin the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or\nboth.\n\nHuck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow\nDouglas' protection introduced him into society--no, dragged him into\nit, hurled him into it--and his sufferings were almost more than he\ncould bear. The widow's servants kept him clean and neat, combed and\nbrushed, and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had\nnot one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know\nfor a friend. He had to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use\nnapkin, cup, and plate; he had to learn his book, he had to go to\nchurch; he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in\nhis mouth; whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of\ncivilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.\n\nHe bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day turned up\nmissing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in\ngreat distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched\nhigh and low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third\nmorning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads\ndown behind the abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found\nthe refugee. Huck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some\nstolen odds and ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with\nhis pipe. He was unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of\nrags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and\nhappy. Tom routed him out, told him the trouble he had been causing,\nand urged him to go home. Huck's face lost its tranquil content, and\ntook a melancholy cast. He said:\n\n\"Don't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work; it don't\nwork, Tom. It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The widder's good to\nme, and friendly; but I can't stand them ways. She makes me get up just\nat the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all to\nthunder; she won't let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them\nblamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don't seem to any air\ngit through 'em, somehow; and they're so rotten nice that I can't set\ndown, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher's; I hain't slid on a\ncellar-door for--well, it 'pears to be years; I got to go to church and\nsweat and sweat--I hate them ornery sermons! I can't ketch a fly in\nthere, I can't chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by\na bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell--everything's\nso awful reg'lar a body can't stand it.\"\n\n\"Well, everybody does that way, Huck.\"\n\n\"Tom, it don't make no difference. I ain't everybody, and I can't\nSTAND it. It's awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy--I don't\ntake no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing; I\ngot to ask to go in a-swimming--dern'd if I hain't got to ask to do\neverything. Well, I'd got to talk so nice it wasn't no comfort--I'd got\nto go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste in\nmy mouth, or I'd a died, Tom. The widder wouldn't let me smoke; she\nwouldn't let me yell, she wouldn't let me gape, nor stretch, nor\nscratch, before folks--\" [Then with a spasm of special irritation and\ninjury]--\"And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a\nwoman! I HAD to shove, Tom--I just had to. And besides, that school's\ngoing to open, and I'd a had to go to it--well, I wouldn't stand THAT,\nTom. Looky here, Tom, being rich ain't what it's cracked up to be. It's\njust worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead\nall the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar'l suits me, and\nI ain't ever going to shake 'em any more. Tom, I wouldn't ever got into\nall this trouble if it hadn't 'a' ben for that money; now you just take\nmy sheer of it along with your'n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes--not\nmany times, becuz I don't give a dern for a thing 'thout it's tollable\nhard to git--and you go and beg off for me with the widder.\"\n\n\"Oh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides if\nyou'll try this thing just a while longer you'll come to like it.\"\n\n\"Like it! Yes--the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to set on it long\nenough. No, Tom, I won't be rich, and I won't live in them cussed\nsmothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and\nI'll stick to 'em, too. Blame it all! just as we'd got guns, and a\ncave, and all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to\ncome up and spile it all!\"\n\nTom saw his opportunity--\n\n\"Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from turning\nrobber.\"\n\n\"No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?\"\n\n\"Just as dead earnest as I'm sitting here. But Huck, we can't let you\ninto the gang if you ain't respectable, you know.\"\n\nHuck's joy was quenched.\n\n\"Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?\"\n\n\"Yes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than what a\npirate is--as a general thing. In most countries they're awful high up\nin the nobility--dukes and such.\"\n\n\"Now, Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't shet me\nout, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, WOULD you, Tom?\"\n\n\"Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I DON'T want to--but what would people\nsay? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang! pretty low characters in\nit!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't like that, and I wouldn't.\"\n\nHuck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally\nhe said:\n\n\"Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if\nI can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the gang, Tom.\"\n\n\"All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll ask the\nwidow to let up on you a little, Huck.\"\n\n\"Will you, Tom--now will you? That's good. If she'll let up on some of\nthe roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd\nthrough or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?\"\n\n\"Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the initiation\nto-night, maybe.\"\n\n\"Have the which?\"\n\n\"Have the initiation.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang's\nsecrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and\nall his family that hurts one of the gang.\"\n\n\"That's gay--that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.\"\n\n\"Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at\nmidnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find--a ha'nted\nhouse is the best, but they're all ripped up now.\"\n\n\"Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom.\"\n\n\"Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with\nblood.\"\n\n\"Now, that's something LIKE! Why, it's a million times bullier than\npirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be\na reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking 'bout it, I reckon\nshe'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.\"\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a BOY, it\nmust stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming\nthe history of a MAN. When one writes a novel about grown people, he\nknows exactly where to stop--that is, with a marriage; but when he\nwrites of juveniles, he must stop where he best can.\n\nMost of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are\nprosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the\nstory of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they\nturned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that\npart of their lives at present.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Complete\nby Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOM SAWYER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 74.txt or 74.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/7/74/\n\nProduced by David Widger.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n    `\n}\n","import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';\nimport { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';\n\nimport { AppModule } from './app/app.module';\nimport { environment } from './environments/environment';\n\nif (environment.production) {\n  enableProdMode();\n}\n\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)\n  .catch(err => console.error(err));\n","function webpackEmptyAsyncContext(req) {\n\t// Here Promise.resolve().then() is used instead of new Promise() to prevent\n\t// uncaught exception popping up in devtools\n\treturn Promise.resolve().then(function() {\n\t\tvar e = new Error(\"Cannot find module '\" + req + \"'\");\n\t\te.code = 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND';\n\t\tthrow e;\n\t});\n}\nwebpackEmptyAsyncContext.keys = function() { return []; };\nwebpackEmptyAsyncContext.resolve = webpackEmptyAsyncContext;\nmodule.exports = webpackEmptyAsyncContext;\nwebpackEmptyAsyncContext.id = \"zn8P\";"],"sourceRoot":"webpack:///"}
